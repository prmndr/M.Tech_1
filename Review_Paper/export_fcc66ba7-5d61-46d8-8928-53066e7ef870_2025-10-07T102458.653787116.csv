Numerical models simulating elastic waves propagation provide valuable insights into the relationship between microstructural properties and laser-induced displacements, but their computational cost renders them impractical for automated high-throughput characterization. To overcome this limitation, we build a metamodel that maps a wide variety of two-dimensional anisotropic polycrystalline microstructures — simplified but representative of features commonly observed in WLAM — to simulated surface displacements. Addressing this challenging high-dimensional regression problem, several neural network surrogates relying on a novel combination of layers are investigated. Their architectures include usual convolutional encoder–decoder elements and spectral layers inspired from the Fourier neural operator (FNO) framework. These layers are adapted and some variants are proposed to provide versatility in network design. All metamodels can run both a forward and backward pass at least 100 times faster than a single forward call of the original model. The best architecture implies a trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. Notably, the architecture involving the channel-wise factorized variant of the spectral layers, which is characterized by a relatively small number of parameters, achieved the lowest approximation error. The metamodel successfully captures the primary effects of anisotropy on wave propagation, even for low-anisotropy inputs not included in the training data. These findings represent a promising initial step towards addressing inversion problems and facilitating the development of online LU testing protocols in additive manufacturing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive Manufacturing; Deep Learning; Laser-ultrasound; Polycrystalline Media; Surface Acoustic Waves; Surrogate Modeling; Acoustic Wave Propagation; Acoustic Waves; Additives; Anisotropy; Backpropagation; Decoding; Fourier Transforms; Laser Applications; Neural Networks; Signal Encoding; Deep Learning; Elastic Wave Propagation; Fourier; Laser Ultrasound; Meta Model; Polycrystalline; Polycrystalline Medium; Surface Acoustic Waves; Surrogate Modeling; Ultrasound Testing; Economic And Social Effects","Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustic waves; Additives; Anisotropy; Backpropagation; Decoding; Fourier transforms; Laser applications; Neural networks; Signal encoding; Deep learning; Elastic wave propagation; Fourier; Laser ultrasound; Meta model; Polycrystalline; Polycrystalline medium; Surface acoustic waves; Surrogate modeling; Ultrasound testing; Economic and social effects","","","Abuabiah, Mohammad, Advancements in Laser Wire-Feed Metal Additive Manufacturing: A Brief Review, Materials, 16, 5, (2023); Argüelles, Andrea P., Mode-converted ultrasonic scattering in polycrystals with elongated grains, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 140, 3, pp. 1570-1580, (2016); Argüelles, Andrea P., Ultrasonic attenuation of polycrystalline materials with a distribution of grain sizes, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 141, 6, pp. 4347-4353, (2017); Bai, Xue, Comparison of ultrasonic attenuation within two- and three-dimensional polycrystalline media, Ultrasonics, 100, (2020); Bakre, Chaitanya, Laser Generated Broadband Rayleigh Waveform Evolution for Metal Additive Manufacturing Process Monitoring, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 23, (2022); Cai, Yongxing, Subwavelength ultrasonic imaging using a deep convolutional neural network trained on structural noise, Ultrasonics, 117, (2021); Cai, Yuhua, A review of in-situ monitoring and process control system in metal-based laser additive manufacturing, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 70, pp. 309-326, (2023); Camus, Théophile, Three-dimensional modeling of solidification grain structures generated by laser powder bed fusion, Materialia, 30, (2023); Cantero-Chinchilla, Sergio, Convolutional neural networks for ultrasound corrosion profile time series regression, NDT and E International, 133, (2023); Cantero-Chinchilla, Sergio, Deep learning in automated ultrasonic NDE – Developments, axioms and opportunities, NDT and E International, 131, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013978719"

We present an Adaptive Extreme Learning Machine (AELM) framework designed to address these engineering challenges. The framework innovatively integrates automated text mining to significantly expand the dataset from literature, utilizes adaptive mechanisms (e.g., feature fusion, temperature bias) within a multi-output regression structure to model complex parameter interactions and temperature dependencies, enabling accurate catalyst performance prediction even under data-scarce conditions. This artificial intelligence approach demonstrates exceptional engineering applicability, achieving up to a 93.3 % improvement in prediction accuracy (measured by Fréchet distance for curve similarity on challenging cases) while reducing computational overhead by approximately 87 % compared to conventional machine learning models like Artificial Neural Networks. Through comprehensive validation across multiple zeolite catalysts, our framework successfully captures the complex relationships between key structural parameters (Copper content: 2–6 wt percent, Silicon/Aluminum ratio: 5–12) and conversion efficiency, even for diverse zeolite catalysts and challenging test conditions. This development provides engineers with a powerful tool for rapid catalyst screening and optimization in real-world emission control applications, offering practical solutions for sustainable environmental protection technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Systems; Machine Learning Framework; Nitrogen Oxides Reduction; Text Mining; Zeolite; Cleaner Production; Environmental Management Systems; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental Testing; Green Computing; Supervised Learning; Catalyst System; Complex Parameter; Emissions Control; Learning Frameworks; Machine Learning Framework; Machine-learning; Multi-scale Approaches; Nitrogen Oxide Reduction; Text-mining; Zeolite Catalyst; Sustainable Development","Cleaner production; Environmental management systems; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental testing; Green computing; Supervised learning; Catalyst system; Complex parameter; Emissions control; Learning frameworks; Machine learning framework; Machine-learning; Multi-scale approaches; Nitrogen oxide reduction; Text-mining; Zeolite catalyst; Sustainable development","","","Bae, Shinyoung, Data-Driven Inference of Synthesis Guidelines for High-Performance Zeolite-Based Selective Catalytic Reduction Catalysts at Low Temperatures, Chemistry of Materials, 34, 17, pp. 7761-7773, (2022); Belgiu, Mariana, Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 114, pp. 24-31, (2016); Biau, Gérard, A random forest guided tour, Test, 25, 2, pp. 197-227, (2016); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Machine Learning Mastery, (2019); Bruix, Albert, First-principles-based multiscale modelling of heterogeneous catalysis, Nature Catalysis, 2, 8, pp. 659-670, (2019); Butler, Keith Tobias, Machine learning for molecular and materials science, Nature, 559, 7715, pp. 547-555, (2018); Chen, Lin, A Complete Multisite Reaction Mechanism for Low-Temperature NH3-SCR over Cu-CHA, ACS Catalysis, 10, 10, pp. 5646-5656, (2020); Cheng, Haodan, Application progress of small-pore zeolites in purifying NOx from motor vehicle exhaust, Chemical Engineering Journal, 449, (2022); Da Costa, Roberto Berlini Rodrigues, Experimental assessment of renewable diesel fuels (HVO/Farnesane) and bioethanol on dual-fuel mode, Energy Conversion and Management, 258, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09521976","","EAAIE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006879678"

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed intraoperative aortic DSA images from patients undergoing EVAR (January 2017–December 2021). An expert panel assessed each sequence for endoleaks. Each sequence was processed into three input channels: peak density, time to peak, and area under the time-density curve, generating three two-dimensional perfusion maps per patient. These maps served as input into a convolutional neural network for binary detection (classification) and localization (regression) of endoleaks through multitask learning. Fivefold cross-validation was performed, with patients split 80:20 into training and testing datasets for each fold. Performance metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F1 score, precision, and recall and were compared with human experts. Results: The study included 220 patients (median age, 74 years [IQR, 68–79]; 181 male). Endoleaks were visible in 111 of 220 (50.5%) patients. The model identified and localized endoleaks with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 ± 0.0031 (SD), F1 score of 0.78 ± 0.21, 95% precision, and 73% recall. Compared with the procedural team (94% precision, 63% recall), it had higher values in both metrics, with an F1 score within the human observer range (0.75–0.85). Balancing regression and classification by multitask learning delivered optimal results. The interobserver agreement among human experts was moderate (Fleiss κ = 0.404). Conclusion: A novel, fully automated deep learning method accurately detected and localized endoleaks at DSA imaging from EVAR procedures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Deep Learning; Digital Subtraction Angiography; Endoleaks; Endovascular Aneurysm Repair; Hybrid Operating Room; Interventional Suite; Alluraclarity Xper Flexmove Fd20; Azurion Flexmove 7 C20; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Aged; Algorithm; American Society Of Anaesthesiologists Score; Area Under The Curve; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Body Mass; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Current Smoker; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Digital Subtraction Angiography; Endoleak; Endovascular Aneurysm Repair; Ex-smoker; Female; Fluoroscopy; Human; Hypertension; Interrater Reliability; Major Clinical Study; Male; Multitask Deep Learning; Never Smoker; Outcome Assessment; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Retrospective Study; Sensitivity And Specificity; Smoking","abdominal aortic aneurysm; aged; algorithm; American Society of Anaesthesiologists score; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; body mass; controlled study; convolutional neural network; current smoker; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital subtraction angiography; endoleak; endovascular aneurysm repair; ex-smoker; female; fluoroscopy; human; hypertension; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; multitask deep learning; never smoker; outcome assessment; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; smoking","","","Buck, Dominique B., Endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 11, 2, pp. 112-123, (2014); Sakalihasan, Natzi, Abdominal aortic aneurysms, Nature Reviews Disease Primers, 4, 1, (2018); Alberga, Anna J., Treatment Outcome Trends for Non-Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: A Nationwide Prospective Cohort Study, European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, 63, 2, pp. 275-283, (2022); Boyle, Jonathan Robert, Editor's Choice – Variation in Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Outcomes by Country: Analysis of International Consortium of Vascular Registries 2010 – 2016, European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, 62, 1, pp. 16-24, (2021); Geraedts, Anna Catharina Maria, Editor's Choice – Post-operative Surveillance and Long Term Outcome after Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair in Patients with an Initial Post-operative Computed Tomography Angiogram Without Abnormalities: the Multicentre Retrospective ODYSSEUS Study, European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, 63, 3, pp. 390-399, (2022); Antoniou, George Athanasios, Late rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm after previous endovascular repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Endovascular Therapy, 22, 5, pp. 734-744, (2015); Wanhainen, Anders, Editor's Choice – European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2019 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Abdominal Aorto-iliac Artery Aneurysms, European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, 57, 1, pp. 8-93, (2019); Chaikof, Elliot L., The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Journal of Vascular Surgery, 67, 1, pp. 2-77.e2, (2018); Wu, Winona W., Surgical treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of patients treated for expanding aneurysm sacs with type II endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair, Journal of Vascular Surgery, 73, 2, pp. 484-493, (2021); Haenssle, Holger Andreas, Man against Machine: Diagnostic performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network for dermoscopic melanoma recognition in comparison to 58 dermatologists, Annals of Oncology, 29, 8, pp. 1836-1842, (2018)","","Radiological Society of North America Inc.","","","","","","26386100","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013602211"

Traditional screening tools, reliant on detailed questionnaires, are costly, time-consuming, and often lack accuracy and generalizability. Automated machine learning (ML) alternatives promise improvements, offering efficient and versatile methods for nutritional assessment. However, they require clean, pre-processed data and careful model selection. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various ML models in predicting malnutrition. We benchmarked 22 different models for both regression and classification tasks using a malnutrition dataset. For this, a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patient case study was adopted. The dataset consists of 412 patients of which 232 were used to train the models. For this, a model development pipeline was developed to ensure robustness and enhance the reproducibility of the constructed models. This is achieved by testing a variety of model types including linear models, tree-based models, neural networks, and other ensemble methods. This resulted in machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks, and to optimize model efficiency by minimizing the number of required input features.

Greenhouse trials are key part in the process of developing and testing new herbicides and analyze the response of the species to different products and doses in a controlled way. The assessment of the damage in the plant is daily done in all trials by visual evaluation by experts. This entails time consuming process and lack of repeatability. Greenhouse trials require new digital tools to reduce time consuming process and to endow the experts with more objective and repetitive methods for establishing the damage in the plants. To this end, a novel method is proposed composed by an initial segmentation of the plant species followed by a multibranch convolutional neural network to estimate the damage level. In this way, we overcome the need for costly and unaffordable pixelwise manual segmentation for damage symptoms and we make use of global damage estimation values provided by the experts. The algorithm has been deployed under real greenhouse trials conditions in a pilot study located in BASF in Germany and tested over four species (GLXMA, TRZAW, ECHCG, AMARE). The results show mean average error (MAE) values ranging from 5.20 for AMARE and 8.07 for ECHCG for the estimation of PDCU value, with correlation values (R2) higher than 0.85 in all situations, and up to 0.92 in AMARE. These results surpass the inter-rater variability of human experts demonstrating that the proposed automated method is appropriate for automatically assessing greenhouse damage trials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Damage Assessment; Deep Learning; Greenhouse; Regression; Automated Approach; Convolutional Neural Network; Damage Assessments; Deep Learning; Image-based; Key Parts; Objective Assessment; Plant Damage; Regression; Visual Evaluation; Convolutional Neural Networks","Automated approach; Convolutional neural network; Damage assessments; Deep learning; Image-based; Key parts; Objective assessment; Plant damage; Regression; Visual evaluation; Convolutional neural networks","","","Ahad, Md Taimur, Comparison of CNN-based deep learning architectures for rice diseases classification, Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture, 9, pp. 22-35, (2023); undefined, (2019); Explainable Artificial Intelligence Xai Concepts Taxonomies Opportunities and Challenges Toward Responsible AI, (2019); Bereciartua-Pérez, Arantza, Insect counting through deep learning-based density maps estimation, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 197, (2022); Smart Agric Technol J, (2022); Bock, Clive H., Plant disease severity estimated visually, by digital photography and image analysis, and by hyperspectral imaging, Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 29, 2, pp. 59-107, (2010); Analysis of Explainers of Black Box Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision A Survey, (2019); Cándido-Mireles, Mayra, Detecting vineyard plants stress in situ using deep learning, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 210, (2023); Chattopadhyay, Aditya, Grad-CAM++: Generalized gradient-based visual explanations for deep convolutional networks, 2018-January, pp. 839-847, (2018); Esgario, José G.M., Deep learning for classification and severity estimation of coffee leaf biotic stress, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 169, (2020)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","25897217","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000389672"

Accurate and rapid predictions of future performance and residual capacity of damaged structural components are crucial to post-event recovery efforts. Traditional assessment methods rely heavily on experts who exercise relatively coarse and qualitative evaluation methods. This setup significantly impacts the efficiency and accuracy of structural condition assessments at regional scales. The present study introduces a workflow that integrates computer vision and deep learning tools for rapid, accurate, and quantitative assessment of structural damage. The proposed end-to-end automated damage assessment workflow can derive the residual capacities of structural components (including stiffness degradation ratio, strength degradation ratio, and damage ratio) from conventional images that can be collected by most of the common handheld devices. The workflow features two custom-designed deep learning modules, a transfer learning-based feature extraction network and a multi-task learning-driven multiple regression prediction network. A database comprising 108 laboratory-scale quasi-static experiments on masonry wall specimens is used for training and testing. The results demonstrate the proposed workflow's effectiveness in quantifying residual capacities such as R<inf>strength</inf>2=0.993,R<inf>stiff</inf>2=0.987,R<inf>damage</inf>2=0.987. The workflow can be further improved by employing more advanced models and utilizing a more comprehensive annotated dataset. It can be deployed by both experts and through crowdsourcing in post-event scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Multi-index Damage; Multi-task Learning; Residual Capacity; Transfer Learning; Damage Detection; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Walls (structural Partitions); Deep Learning; Degradation Ratios; Masonry Walls; Multi-index; Multi-index Damage; Multitask Learning; Residual Capacity; Structural Component; Transfer Learning; Work-flows; Retaining Walls","Damage detection; Deep reinforcement learning; Walls (structural partitions); Deep learning; Degradation ratios; Masonry walls; Multi-index; Multi-index damage; Multitask learning; Residual capacity; Structural component; Transfer learning; Work-flows; Retaining walls","","","Asjodi, Amir Hossein, Peak drift ratio estimation for unreinforced masonry walls using visual features of damage, Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, 20, 15, pp. 8357-8379, (2022); Atha, Deegan J., Evaluation of deep learning approaches based on convolutional neural networks for corrosion detection, Structural Health Monitoring, 17, 5, pp. 1110-1128, (2018); Bai, Zhilin, Image-based reinforced concrete component mechanical damage recognition and structural safety rapid assessment using deep learning with frequency information, Automation in Construction, 150, (2023); Bansal, Aayushi, A Systematic Review on Data Scarcity Problem in Deep Learning: Solution and Applications, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 10, (2022); undefined, (2019); Buscema, Paolo Massimo, Back propagation neural networks, Substance Use and Misuse, 33, 2, pp. 233-270, (1998); Caruana, Rich A., Multitask Learning, Machine Learning, 28, 1, pp. 41-75, (1997); Caruana, Rich A., Multitask Learning: A Knowledge-Based Source of Inductive Bias, pp. 41-48, (1993); Cha, Young Jin, Deep Learning-Based Crack Damage Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks, Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 32, 5, pp. 361-378, (2017); Cha, Young Jin, Autonomous Structural Visual Inspection Using Region-Based Deep Learning for Detecting Multiple Damage Types, Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 33, 9, pp. 731-747, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","14740346","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217710662"

In this paper, we present a novel multi-dimensional multi-modal network (MDMNet) to identify functional limitation of organ systems via CPET, which is of great importance in clinical practice and yet a challenging task due to (1) the intricate intra-variable associations, and (2) the significant inter-individual variability. Methods: The proposed model has three compelling characteristics. First, we employ a dedicated embedding strategy for CPET data to map raw inputs into the learned embedding space, facilitating the detection of latent features of physiological variables. Second, we devise a novel multi-dimensional feature extraction module to capture rich features of physiological inputs at different dimensions, which consists of a one-dimensional feature extraction branch unfolding both temporal and spatial patterns of the entire data, and a two-dimensional feature extraction branch based on Gramian Angular Field (GAF) encoding to reveal the complicated temporal correlation relationships between time points within a variable. Third, we integrate these techniques with clinically significant demographic information to establish our MDMNet incorporating multi-dimensional with multi-modal learning, thereby further addressing the issues of complex intra-variable associations and inter-individual variability simultaneously. Results: We evaluated the proposed method on the publicly available CPET dataset, achieving AUC scores of 0.948, 0.949 and 0.931 for three tasks respectively. Conclusions: The superiority of our method in discerning inter-individual differences was further demonstrated through partial least squares discriminant analysis, which holds significant potential for automated clinical application of CPET. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing; Inter-individual Variability; Multi-dimensional Learning; Multi-modal Learning; Organ System Limitation Identification; Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing; Features Extraction; Individual Variability; Inter-individual Variability; Multi Dimensional; Multi-dimensional Learning; Multi-modal Learning; Multimodal Network; Organ System Limitation Identification; Organ Systems; Physiological Models; Adult; Area Under The Curve; Article; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Clinical Practice; Controlled Study; Diagnosis; Discriminant Analysis; Exercise Test; Feature Extraction; Female; Human; Learning; Male; Partial Least Squares Regression; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Middle Aged; Physiology; Procedures; Adult; Algorithms; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer","Cardiopulmonary exercise testing; Features extraction; Individual variability; Inter-individual variability; Multi dimensional; Multi-dimensional learning; Multi-modal learning; Multimodal network; Organ system limitation identification; Organ systems; Physiological models; adult; area under the curve; article; cardiorespiratory fitness; clinical practice; controlled study; diagnosis; discriminant analysis; exercise test; feature extraction; female; human; learning; male; partial least squares regression; algorithm; artificial neural network; middle aged; physiology; procedures; Adult; Algorithms; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer","","","Raghuveer, Geetha, Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Youth: An Important Marker of Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association, Circulation, 142, 7, pp. E101-E118, (2020); Balady, Gary J., Clinician's guide to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in adults: A scientific statement from the American heart association, Circulation, 122, 2, pp. 191-225, (2010); Adachi, Hitoshi, Cardiopulmonary exercise test: The most powerful tool to detect hidden pathophysiology, International Heart Journal, 58, 5, pp. 654-665, (2017); Guazzi, Marco, 2016 focused update: Clinical recommendations for cardiopulmonary exercise testing data assessment in specific patient populations, European Heart Journal, 39, 14, pp. 1144-1161, (2018); Yurtman, Aras, Automated evaluation of physical therapy exercises using multi-template dynamic time warping on wearable sensor signals, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 117, 2, pp. 189-207, (2014); Romero, Daniel A., Predicting 6-minute walking test outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without physical performance measures, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 225, (2022); Kitzman, Dalane W., Exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function: Failure of the Frank-Starling mechanism, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 17, 5, pp. 1065-1072, (1991); Wasserman, Karlmann, Coupling of external to cellular respiration during exercise: The wisdom of the body revisited, American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism, 266, 4 29-4, pp. E519-E539, (1994); Hansen, James E., Pathophysiology of activity limitation in patients with interstitial lung disease, Chest, 109, 6, pp. 1566-1576, (1996); Herdy, Artur Haddad, Cardiopulmonary exercise test: Background, applicability and interpretation, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia, 107, 5, pp. 467-481, (2016)","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","01692607; 18727565","","CMPBE","39671821","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211607045"

However, SA testing is time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting its accessibility in clinical practice. This study aimed to develop a multi-class classification model that predicts SA results using pure-tone audiometry (PTA) data, enabling a more efficient and automated assessment. To achieve this, we implemented and compared MLP, RNN, gradient boosting, and XGBoost models, evaluating their performance using accuracy, F1 score, log loss, and confusion matrix analysis. Experimental results showed that gradient boosting achieved the highest accuracy, 86.22%, while XGBoost demonstrated a more balanced classification performance. The MLP achieved 85.77% and the RNN achieved 85.41%, exhibiting relatively low accuracy, with the RNN showing limitations due to the low temporal dependency of PTA data. Additionally, all models faced challenges predicting class 2 (borderline hearing levels) due to overlapping data distributions. These findings suggest that machine learning models, particularly gradient boosting and XGBoost, outperform deep learning models in SA prediction. Future research should focus on feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and ensemble approaches to enhance performance and validate real-world applicability. The proposed model could contribute to automating SA prediction and improving hearing assessment efficiency and patient care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Gradient Boosting; Hearing Assessment; Machine Learning; Multilayer Perceptron; Pure-tone Audiometry; Recurrent Neural Network; Regression Analysis In Audiology; Speech Audiometry; Xgboost; Adaptive Boosting; Diagnosis; Multilayer Neural Networks; Prediction Models; Recurrent Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Gradient Boosting; Hearing Assessment; Machine-learning; Multilayers Perceptrons; Neural-networks; Pure Tone Audiometry; Regression Analyze In Audiology; Speech Audiometry; Xgboost; Audiometers","Adaptive boosting; Diagnosis; Multilayer neural networks; Prediction models; Recurrent neural networks; Deep learning; Gradient boosting; Hearing assessment; Machine-learning; Multilayers perceptrons; Neural-networks; Pure tone audiometry; Regression analyze in audiology; Speech audiometry; Xgboost; Audiometers","","","World Information Technology and Engineering Journal, (2023); Khalil, Mohamad, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistical Analysis for forecasting building energy consumption — A systematic review, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 115, (2022); Bhatt, Chandradeep, The state of the art of deep learning models in medical science and their challenges, Multimedia Systems, 27, 4, pp. 599-613, (2021); Shehab, Mohammad M., Machine learning in medical applications: A review of state-of-the-art methods, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 145, (2022); Hoff, Maria, Accuracy of automated pure-tone audiometry in population-based samples of older adults, International Journal of Audiology, 63, 8, pp. 622-630, (2024); Ryćko, Przemysław, Speech recognition and speech audiometry parameters in evaluation of aural rehabilitation progress in cochlear implant patients.

Unnecessary test runs and delays in finding faults occur because static methods do not adjust when new defects appear. Reordering test cases dynamically based on changing conditions can improve prioritization. A model that updates test rankings using past execution patterns, uncertainty estimation, and retraining triggers is introduced in this study as Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Test Case Prioritization (ADRL-TCP). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) stores test effectiveness across multiple cycles. Test cases are ranked based on their likelihood of revealing failures using Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Prioritization is updated without restarting the entire learning process through incremental retraining. In continuous integration environments, the model is tested and compared to Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Prioritization (RL-TCP) and Prioritized Experience Replay Based on Dynamics Priority (PERDP). Finding failures requires fewer test executions, and faults are detected earlier using ADRL-TCP. Past outcomes and recent changes influence test rankings due to the memory-based learning approach. High-risk test cases receive earlier execution because prioritization is adjusted based on uncertainty awareness. Reducing test overhead while maintaining fault detection consistency in continuous testing environments is possible through ADRL-TCP, which adjusts as software evolves. Risk-aware ranking, adaptive retraining, and learning-based memory integration improve test prioritization, as observed in these findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Learning; Automated Retraining; Continuous Integration; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Fault Detection.; Software Testing; Test Case Prioritization; Uncertainty Estimation","","","","Bagherzadeh, Mojtaba, Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Prioritization, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 48, 8, pp. 2836-2856, (2022); Commun Appl Nonlinear Anal, (2024); Requirements Business Value and Test Case Attributes Based Test Case Prioritization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning, (2023); Omri, Safa, Learning to Rank for Test Case Prioritization, pp. 16-24, (2023); Waqar, Muhammad, Test Suite Prioritization Based on Optimization Approach Using Reinforcement Learning, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 13, (2022); Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Systems and Software Product Line Volume A Volume A, (2020); Rotaru, Ioana Claudia, Test Case Prioritization Based on Neural Network Classification with Artifacts Traceability, pp. 78-87, (2023); Nguyen, Vu Thanh D., RLTCP: A reinforcement learning approach to prioritizing automated user interface tests, Information and Software Technology, 136, (2021); Li, Hu, Prioritized experience replay based on dynamics priority, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Jiang, Minqi, Prioritized Level Replay, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 139, pp. 4940-4950, (2021)","","Little Lion Scientific","","","","","","19928645; 18173195","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016891370"

This study explores a hybrid framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and traditional machine learning classifiers to distinguish between three common skin conditions: Psoriasis, Eczema, and Tinea Ringworm. A curated dataset of 2,750 clinical images sourced from DermNet and the Atlas of Dermatology was used, with two dataset splits: 70:15:15 and 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Feature extraction was performed using five deep learning backbones—EfficientNet-B0, ResNet50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, Swin-Tiny, and DeiT-Small. To reduce dimensionality and enhance relevance, five feature selection techniques were applied: Boruta, Chi-Square, ANOVA, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Kruskal–Wallis (KW). The selected features were then used to train five classical machine learning classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). All experiments were repeated with three random seeds (42, 99, and 123) to ensure robustness. Among the combinations, ConvNeXt-Tiny features selected via Boruta and classified using SVM delivered the best hybrid result, achieving an accuracy of 79.78%, a notable improvement over the baseline of 74.7% ± 0.0% on the 80:10:10 split. Additionally, an end-to-end classification approach was evaluated using four backbone models—ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Swin-Tiny—also across three runs with seeds 42, 99, and 123. Among these, the Swin-Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 82.1% ± 1.3%. These findings demonstrate the strength of hybrid approaches that leverage both deep learning for feature extraction and classical machine learning for classification, alongside the competitive edge of end-to-end deep learning, particularly in dermatological image analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Dermatology; Machine Learning; Skin Diseases; Vision Transformers; Classification (of Information); Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Neural Networks; Diseases; Extraction; Feature Extraction; Learning Systems; Logistic Regression; Medical Image Processing; Multilayers; Nearest Neighbor Search; Random Forests; Skin; Statistical Tests; Support Vector Machines; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Disease Classification; End To End; Features Extraction; Learning Classifiers; Machine-learning; Skin Disease; Support Vectors Machine; Vision Transformer; Dermatology","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Medical image processing; Multilayers; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Skin; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease classification; End to end; Features extraction; Learning classifiers; Machine-learning; Skin disease; Support vectors machine; Vision transformer; Dermatology","","","Gupta, Pragya, A survey on computer vision approaches for automated classification of skin diseases, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 84, 11, pp. 8673-8705, (2025); Banerjee, Arnab, Skin Diseases Detection Using LBP and WLD: An Ensembling Approach, SN Computer Science, 5, 1, (2024); Math Stat Eng Appl, (2022); Aboulmira, Amina, Comparative Study of Multiple CNN Models for Classification of 23 Skin Diseases, International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 18, 11, pp. 127-142, (2022); Journal of Computing Biomedical Informatics, (2024); Saha, Dip Kumar, YoTransViT: A transformer and CNN method for predicting and classifying skin diseases using segmentation techniques, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 47, (2024); Mohan, Jayanth, Enhancing skin disease classification leveraging transformer-based deep learning architectures and explainable AI, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 190, (2025); Abdel Mawgoud, Ramy, Visual explainability of 250 skin diseases viewed through the eyes of an AI-based, self-supervised vision transformer—A clinical perspective, JEADV Clinical Practice, 4, 1, pp. 145-155, (2025); Ali, Armughan, xCViT: Improved Vision Transformer Network with Fusion of CNN and Xception for Skin Disease Recognition with Explainable AI, Computers, Materials and Continua, 83, 1, pp. 1367-1398, (2025); K, Mallikharjuna Rao, LesionAid: vision transformers-based skin lesion generation and classification – A practical review, Multimedia Tools and Applications, (2025)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016609711"

Elevated intraocular pressure due to this accretion may cause damage to the optic nerve and result in loss of vision. It may start peripherally and then progress to the point of interfering with central vision. Patients with glaucoma typically do not have noticeable symptoms until many months or years after the onset of optic nerve damage. This article will present a new trend in researching DL architectures in automated systems to segment handcrafted features in fundus images. In this novel approach, the model integrates DL and ML techniques, applied to raw fundus images, to help experts detect glaucoma. Outputs of the CNN were taken as deep features and forwarded through different machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, logistic regression, linear regression, Adaboost, stacking, and linear discriminant analysis for the classification of images. The performances of these hybrid models were tested with the ACRIMA dataset, which consists of 705 images divided by 70% for training purposes and 30% for testing purposes.

By subtly manipulating phishing websites, attackers can evade detection. The threats posed by evasion attacks necessitate proactive robustness testing of these detectors prior to deployment. Traditional red teaming efforts, where security experts manually emulate attacker behaviors, are labor-intensive and limited in scalability. To address this challenge, we propose an automated red teaming framework leveraging action-masked reinforcement learning (RL) to realistically emulate evasion attacks and evaluate the robustness of ML-based phishing website detectors. Our RL agent is equipped with HTML manipulation techniques commonly used by human attackers. Additionally, action masking ensures the RL agent selects only evasion actions that are feasible for a given website and prevents compromising website rendering. We evaluate our approach by testing the robustness of three ML-based detectors: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high evasion capabilities and efficiency in converting detectable phishing websites into well-rendered evasion ones, thus effectively testing the robustness of the detectors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Phishing; Red Teaming; Reinforcement Learning; Computer Crime; Convolutional Neural Networks; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Logistic Regression; Network Security; Phishing; Websites; Well Testing; Labour-intensive; Machine-learning; Manipulation Techniques; Phishing Websites; Red Teaming; Reinforcement Learning Agent; Reinforcement Learnings; Robustness Testing; Security Experts; Reinforcement Learning","Computer crime; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Network security; Phishing; Websites; Well testing; Labour-intensive; Machine-learning; Manipulation techniques; Phishing websites; Red teaming; Reinforcement learning agent; Reinforcement learnings; Robustness testing; Security experts; Reinforcement learning","","","Phishing Activity Trends Report, (2006); Abbasi, Ahmed Ali, Enhancing predictive analytics for anti-phishing by exploiting website genre information, Journal of Management Information Systems, 31, 4, pp. 109-157, (2015); Opara, Chidimma, HTMLPhish: Enabling Phishing Web Page Detection by Applying Deep Learning Techniques on HTML Analysis, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, (2020); Ouyang, Linshu, Phishing Web Page Detection with HTML-Level Graph Neural Network, pp. 952-958, (2021); Aljofey, Ali, An effective detection approach for phishing websites using URL and HTML features, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Apruzzese, Giovanni, SpacePhish: The Evasion-space of Adversarial Attacks against Phishing Website Detectors using Machine Learning, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 171-185, (2022); Montaruli, Biagio, Raze to the Ground: Query-Efficient Adversarial HTML Attacks on Machine-Learning Phishing Webpage Detectors, pp. 233-244, (2021); What is Red Teaming; Safi, Asadullah, A systematic literature review on phishing website detection techniques, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 35, 2, pp. 590-611, (2023); Charmet, Fabien, Towards Polyvalent Adversarial Attacks on URL Classification Engines, pp. 1246-1248, (2022)","Blanton, M.; Enck, W.; Nita-Rotaru, C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","46th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops, SPW 2025","","San Francisco; CA","210046","","9798331566432","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010822679"

Since this class of software learns its logic from historical data, it can encode or amplify discriminatory practices. Previous research on algorithmic fairness has focused on improving 'average-case' fairness. On the other hand, fairness at the extreme ends of the spectrum, which often signifies lasting and impactful shifts in societal attitudes, has received significantly less emphasis. Leveraging the statistics of extreme value theory (EVT), we propose a novel fairness criterion called extreme counterfactual discrimination (ECD). This criterion estimates the worst-case amounts of disadvantage in outcomes for individuals solely based on their memberships in a protected group. Utilizing tools from search-based software engineering and generative AI, we present a randomized algorithm that samples a statistically significant set of points from the tail of ML outcome distributions even if the input dataset lacks a sufficient number of relevant samples. We conducted several experiments on four ML models (deep neural networks, logistic regression, and random forests) over 10 socially relevant tasks from the literature on algorithmic fairness. First, we evaluate the generative AI methods and find that they generate sufficient samples to infer valid EVT distribution in 95% of cases. Remarkably, we found that the prevalent bias mitigators reduce the average-case discrimination but increase the worst-case discrimination significantly in 35% of cases. We also observed that even the tail-aware mitigation algorithm-MiniMax-Fairness-increased the worst-case discrimination in 30% of cases. We propose a novel ECD-based mitigator that improves fairness in the tail in 90% of cases with no degradation of the average-case discrimination. We hope that the EVT framework serves as a robust tool for evaluating fairness in both average-case and worst-case discrimination. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Extreme Value Theory; Fairness; Software Testing; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Support Systems; Decision Theory; Discriminators; Logistic Regression; Random Forests; Software Design; Algorithmics; Average-case; Counterfactuals; Critical Component; Data Driven; Decision Supports; Extreme Value Theory; Fairness; Software Testings; Support Systems; Software Testing","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Discriminators; Logistic regression; Random forests; Software design; Algorithmics; Average-case; Counterfactuals; Critical component; Data driven; Decision supports; Extreme value theory; Fairness; Software testings; Support systems; Software testing","","","Deep Learning, (2016); Reinforcement Learning an Introduction, (2018); Bert Pre Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Chatgpt Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue, (2022); Machine Bias, (2021); Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment and Technology Law, (2021); William Mary Bill of Rights Journal, (2021); Irs is Targeting the Poorest Americans, (2021); Tizpaz-Niari, Saeid, Metamorphic Testing and Debugging of Tax Preparation Software, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 2023-May, pp. 138-149, (2023); Petrongolo, Barbara, The gender gap in employment and wages, Nature Human Behaviour, 3, 4, pp. 316-318, (2019)","","IEEE Computer Society","ACM SIGSOFT; Carleton University; et al.; IBM; IEEE Computer Society (and TCSE); University of Ottawa","47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2025","","Ottawa; ON","209953","02705257","9781450392266; 9780769528625; 9781450305761; 9781450305839; 1581132069; 9781450357401; 9798400705007; 9781605589701; 9781595934055; 9781595934079","PCSED","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010310037"

However, these systems are highly sensitive to input variations, such as noise and changes in lighting, which can compromise their effectiveness and potentially lead to safety-critical failures. This study offers a comprehensive empirical evaluation of image perturbations, techniques commonly used to assess the robustness of DNNs, to validate and improve the robustness and generalization of ADAS perception systems. We first conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying 38 categories of perturbations. Next, we evaluated their effectiveness in revealing failures in two different ADAS, both at the component and at the system level. Finally, we explored the use of perturbation-based data augmentation and continuous learning strategies to improve ADAS adaptation to new operational design domains. Our results demonstrate that all categories of image perturbations successfully expose robustness issues in ADAS and that the use of dataset augmentation and continuous learning significantly improves ADAS performance in novel, unseen environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Driving Systems Testing; Robustness; Autonomous Vehicles; Deep Neural Networks; Robustness (control Systems); Semantic Segmentation; Advanced Driver Assistances; Automated Driving; Autonomous Driving; Autonomous Driving System Testing; Continuous Learning; Driver-assistance Systems; Driving Systems; Neural-networks; Robustness; System Testing; Advanced Driver Assistance Systems","Autonomous vehicles; Deep neural networks; Robustness (control systems); Semantic Segmentation; Advanced driver assistances; Automated driving; Autonomous driving; Autonomous driving system testing; Continuous learning; Driver-assistance systems; Driving systems; Neural-networks; Robustness; System testing; Advanced driver assistance systems","","","Tang, Shuncheng, A Survey on Automated Driving System Testing: Landscapes and Trends, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 32, 5, (2023); Yurtsever, Ekim, A Survey of Autonomous Driving: Common Practices and Emerging Technologies, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 58443-58469, (2020); Panoptic Perception for Autonomous Driving A Survey, (2024); Grigorescu, Sorin Mihai, A survey of deep learning techniques for autonomous driving, Journal of Field Robotics, 37, 3, pp. 362-386, (2020); Dodge, Samuel F., Understanding how image quality affects deep neural networks, (2016); Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2018); Hendrycks, Dan, Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations, (2019); Hendrycks, Dan, AUGMIX: A SIMPLE DATA PROCESSING METHOD TO IMPROVE ROBUSTNESS AND UNCERTAINTY, (2020); Rusak, Evgenia, A Simple Way to Make Neural Networks Robust Against Diverse Image Corruptions, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12348 LNCS, pp. 53-69, (2020); Laermann, Jan, Achieving Generalizable Robustness of Deep Neural Networks by Stability Training, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11824 LNCS, pp. 360-373, (2019)","Fasolino, A.R.; Panichella, S.; Aleti, A.; Mesbah, A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","CeR ICT; et al.; Federico II University of Naples; Hitachi; IEEE Computer Society; University of Bern","18th IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2025","","Naples","208972","","9798331508142","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007549505"

To ensure consistent code quality while still allowing fast development cycles, Continuous Integration (CI) is commonly applied. However, operating CI at such scale not only leads to a single point of failure for many developers, but also requires computational resources that may reach feasibility limits and cause long feedback latencies. To address these issues, developers commonly split test executions across multiple pipelines, running small and fast tests in pre-submit stages while executing long-running and flaky tests in post-submit pipelines. Given the long runtimes of many pipelines and the substantial proportion of passing test executions (98 % in our pre-submit pipelines), there not only a need but also potential for further improvements by prioritizing and selecting tests. However, many previously proposed regression optimization techniques are unfit for an industrial context, because they (1) rely on complex and difficult-to-obtain features like per-test code coverage that are not feasible in large, multi-language environments, (2) do not automatically adapt to rapidly changing systems where new tests are continuously added or modified, and (3) are not designed to distinguish the different objectives of pre- and post-submit pipelines: While pre-submit testing should prioritize failing tests, post-submit pipelines should prioritize tests that indicate non-flaky changes by transitioning from pass to fail outcomes or vice versa. To overcome these issues, we developed a lightweight and pipeline-aware regression test optimization approach that employs Reinforcement Learning models trained on language-agnostic features. We evaluated our approach on a large industry dataset collected over a span of 20 weeks of CI test executions. When predicting the failure likelihood in pre-submit pipelines, our approach scheduled the first failing test within the first 16 % of tests, outperforming existing approaches. When predicting test transitions in the post-submit pipeline, it was able to select 87 % of developer-relevant tests by cutting the test execution time in half and over 99 % within five cycles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Integration; Regression Test Prioritization; Regression Test Selection; Reinforcement Learning; Computer Operating Systems; Software Quality; Continuous Integrations; Monolithics; Multi Languages; Regression Test Prioritization; Regression Test Selection; Regression Tests; Reinforcement Learnings; Test Execution; Test Optimization; Test Prioritization; Software Testing","Computer operating systems; Software quality; Continuous integrations; Monolithics; Multi languages; Regression test prioritization; Regression test selection; Regression tests; Reinforcement learnings; Test execution; Test optimization; Test prioritization; Software testing","","","Potvin, Rachel, Why google stores billions of lines of code in a single repository, Communications of the ACM, 59, 7, pp. 78-87, (2016); Largest Git Repo on the Planet, (2017); Scaling Mercurial at Facebook, (2014); Uber Technology Day Monorepo to Multirepo and Back Again, (2017); Memon, Atif M., Taming google-scale continuous testing, pp. 233-242, (2017); Wang, Ziyuan, Cost-cognizant combinatorial test case prioritization, International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 21, 6, pp. 829-854, (2011); Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, (2008); Pan, Rongqi, Test case selection and prioritization using machine learning: a systematic literature review, Empirical Software Engineering, 27, 2, (2022); Zuul A Project Gating System, (2023); Using Bazel, (2023)","Fasolino, A.R.; Panichella, S.; Aleti, A.; Mesbah, A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","CeR ICT; et al.; Federico II University of Naples; Hitachi; IEEE Computer Society; University of Bern","18th IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2025","","Naples","208972","","9798331508142","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007502645"

This study explores the use of the VGG19 architecture combined with three classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for classifying hairline and spiral fractures in X-ray images. A dataset of 400 X-ray images was utilized, from which features were extracted using the VGG19 model. These features were then used to train the SVM, LR, and kNN classifiers. Among the models tested, the VGG19-LR pipeline demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving high accuracy and robustness in both validation and testing phases. The VGG19-SVM model also showed strong performance but was slightly less effective than the VGG19-LR. In contrast, the VGG19-kNN model yielded the weakest results, indicating lower suitability for this classification task. These results suggest that the VGG19-LR pipeline was suitable for the given dataset. The high accuracy demonstrated indicates that transfer learning can offer an efficient method for classifying bone fractures, particularly for hairline and spiral fracture, in contrast to training a deep neural network from the beginning. This enables the creation of automated bone fracture diagnosis using computer vision and deep learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bone Fracture Classification; K-nearest Neighbors (knn); Logistic Regression (lr); Medical Imaging; Support Vector Machine (svm); Vgg19convolutional Neural Networks (cnns); Deep Neural Networks; Medical Imaging; Nearest Neighbor Search; Support Vector Regression; Bone Fracture; Bone Fracture Classification; K-near Neighbor; Logistic Regression; Logistics Regressions; Nearest-neighbour; Neural-networks; Support Vector Machine; Support Vectors Machine; Vgg19convolutional Neural Network (cnn)","Deep neural networks; Medical imaging; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector regression; Bone fracture; Bone fracture classification; K-near neighbor; Logistic regression; Logistics regressions; Nearest-neighbour; Neural-networks; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Vgg19convolutional neural network (CNN)","","","Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2017); Yadav, Dhirendra Prasad, Bone Fracture Detection and Classification using Deep Learning Approach, pp. 282-285, (2020); Miccai, (2015); Yadav, Dhirendra Prasad, Hybrid SFNet Model for Bone Fracture Detection and Classification Using ML/DL, Sensors, 22, 15, (2022); IEEE, (2022); Luo, Yang, Liquid Natural Gas Cold Energy Recovery for Integration of Sustainable District Cooling Systems: A Thermal Performance Analysis, Inventions, 8, 5, (2023); Barhoom, Alaa M.A., BONE ABNORMALITIES DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING-VGG16 ALGORITHM, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 100, 20, pp. 6173-6184, (2022); Roboflow Universe, (2024); Ioffe, Sergey, Batch normalization: Accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift, 1, pp. 448-456, (2015); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014)","Chen, W.; Ping Tan, A.H.; Luo, Y.; Huang, L.; Zhu, Y.; PP Abdul Majeed, A.; Zhang, F.; Yan, Y.; Liu, C.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","2nd International Conference on Intelligent Manufacturing and Robotics, ICIMR 2024","","Suzhou","329839","23673389; 23673370","9789819652372; 9783031931055; 9789819662968; 9783031999963; 9783031950162; 9783031947698; 9783032004406; 9783031910074; 9783031926105; 9789819639410","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002723733"

A common approach involves designing testing scenarios based on prior knowledge of CAVs (e.g., surrogate models), conducting tests in these scenarios, and subsequently evaluating CAVs’ safety performances. However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency. In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process. Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency. We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps. The effectiveness of our method is validated in high-dimensional overtaking scenarios, demonstrating that our approach achieves notable evaluation efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Testing Environment Generation; Connected And Automated Vehicles; Dense Reinforcement Learning; Automobile Testing; Adaptive Testing; Adaptive Testing Environment Generation; Automated Vehicles; Connected And Automated Vehicle; Dense Reinforcement Learning; Prior-knowledge; Reinforcement Learnings; Safety Performance; Surrogate Modeling; Testing Environment; Reinforcement Learning","Automobile testing; Adaptive testing; Adaptive testing environment generation; Automated vehicles; Connected and automated vehicle; Dense reinforcement learning; Prior-knowledge; Reinforcement learnings; Safety performance; Surrogate modeling; Testing environment; Reinforcement learning","","","Kalra, Nidhi, Driving to safety: How many miles of driving would it take to demonstrate autonomous vehicle reliability?, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 94, pp. 182-193, (2016); Li, Li, Intelligence testing for autonomous vehicles: A new approach, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 1, 2, pp. 158-164, (2016); Li, Li, Artificial intelligence test: a case study of intelligent vehicles, Artificial Intelligence Review, 50, 3, pp. 441-465, (2018); Li, Li, Parallel testing of vehicle intelligence via virtual-real interaction, Science Robotics, 4, 28, (2019); Mullins, Galen E., Automated generation of diverse and challenging scenarios for test and evaluation of autonomous vehicles, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1443-1450, (2017); Menzel, Till, Scenarios for Development, Test and Validation of Automated Vehicles, 2018-June, pp. 1821-1827, (2018); Jana, Suman, DeepTest: Automated testing of deep-neural-network-driven autonomous cars, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 2018-May, (2018); Efficient Black Box Assessment of Autonomous Vehicle Safety, (2019); Tuncali, Cumhur Erkan, Requirements-Driven Test Generation for Autonomous Vehicles with Machine Learning Components, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 5, 2, pp. 265-280, (2020); Sinha, Aman, Neural bridge sampling for evaluating safety-critical autonomous systems, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15580016; 15249050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001550786"

In this paper, we construct a machine learning model for the prediction of angiographic coronary artery disease by HFQRS analysis of cycling exercise ECG. Methods and results: This study prospectively included 140 inpatients and 59 healthy volunteers undergoing cycling exercise ECG. The CHD group (N=104) and non-CHD group (N=95) were determined by coronary angiography gold standard. Automated HF QRS analysis was performed by the blinded method. The coronary group was predominantly male, with a higher prevalence of age, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes than the non-coronary group (P<0.001), higher lipid levels in the coronary group (P<0.005), significantly longer QRS duration during exercise testing (P<0.005), more positive leads (P<0.001), and a greater proportion of significant changes in HFQRS (P<0.001).

However, it is vulnerable to environmental temperature variations. An automated ultrasonic-based diagnosis approach integrating the continuous wavelet transform, and the transfer learning enhanced deep convolutional neural networks is proposed to evaluate compressive damage amidst temperature variations. The ultrasonic tests were conducted on pre-damaged concrete specimens, considering both temperature variations and damage levels as variables. The results indicate that the temperature fluctuations significantly influence the ultrasonic parameters of concrete compression damage. The proposed method effectively identifies the concrete damage state amidst temperature variations. Furthermore, it is recommended that the temperature range within the training set should uniformly cover the expected temperature range throughout the lifespan of concrete structures.

Inspection, tactile, and radiographic examinations can be time-consuming and error-prone, which may delay diagnosis. Consequently, an objective, automatic, and reliable process is required for identifying dental crown defects. This study aimed to explore the potential of transforming acoustic emission (AE) signals to continuous wavelet transform (CWT), combined with Conventional Neural Network (CNN) to assist in crack detection. A new CNN image segmentation model, based on multi-class semantic segmentation using Inception-ResNet-v2, was developed. Real-time detection of AE signals under loads, which induce cracking, provided significant insights into crack formation in MZ crowns. Pencil lead breaking (PLB) was used to simulate crack propagation. The CWT and CNN models were used to automate the crack classification process. The Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture with transfer learning categorized the cracks in MZ crowns into five groups: labial, palatal, incisal, left, and right. After 2000 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.0001, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.4667%, demonstrating that deep learning significantly improved the localization of cracks in MZ crowns. This development can potentially aid dentists in clinical decision-making by facilitating the early detection and prevention of crack failures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acoustic Emission (ae); Continuous Wavelet Transform (cwt); Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Crack; Deep Learning; Inception-resnet-v2; Monolithic Zirconia Dental Crown; Pencil Lead Breaking (plb); Zirconium; Zirconium Oxide; Zirconium; Zirconium Oxide; Acoustic Emission Testing; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crack Detection; Crack Propagation; Deep Neural Networks; Dental Braces; Dentistry; Diagnostic Radiography; Light Transmission; Wavelet Transforms; Z Transforms; Zirconia Refractories; Acoustic Emission; Acoustic-emissions; Breakings; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Dental Crowns; Inception-resnet-v2; Monolithic Zirconias; Monolithic Zirconium Dental Crown; Pencil Lead Breaking; Pencil Leads; Semantic Segmentation; Zirconium; Zirconium Oxide; Acoustics; Artificial Neural Network; Chemistry; Deep Learning; Human; Tooth Crown; Wavelet Analysis; Acoustics; Crowns; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Wavelet Analysis; Zirconium","Acoustic emission testing; Convolutional neural networks; Crack detection; Crack propagation; Deep neural networks; Dental braces; Dentistry; Diagnostic radiography; Light transmission; Wavelet transforms; Z transforms; Zirconia refractories; Acoustic emission; Acoustic-emissions; Breakings; Continuous wavelet transform; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Dental crowns; Inception-resnet-v2; Monolithic zirconias; Monolithic zirconium dental crown; Pencil lead breaking; Pencil leads; Semantic Segmentation; zirconium; zirconium oxide; acoustics; artificial neural network; chemistry; deep learning; human; tooth crown; wavelet analysis; Acoustics; Crowns; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Wavelet Analysis; Zirconium","","zirconium, 14940-68-2, 7440-67-7; zirconium oxide, 1314-23-4, 53801-45-9; Zirconium; zirconium oxide","Malkondu, Özlem, An overview of monolithic zirconia in dentistry, Biotechnology and Biotechnological Equipment, 30, 4, pp. 644-652, (2016); Advances in Ceramics Electric and Magnetic Ceramics Bioceramics Ceramics and Environment, (2011); Denry, Isabelle L., State of the art of zirconia for dental applications, Dental Materials, 24, 3, pp. 299-307, (2008); Della Bona, Alvaro, Zirconia as a dental biomaterial, Materials, 8, 8, pp. 4978-4991, (2015); Luthardt, Ralph Gunnar, CAD/CAM-machining effects on Y-TZP zirconia, Dental Materials, 20, 7, pp. 655-662, (2004); Melo, Gilberto De Souza, Association of sleep bruxism with ceramic restoration failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, 119, 3, pp. 354-362, (2018); Heller, Hadas, Survival and Success Rates of Monolithic Zirconia Restorations Supported by Teeth and Implants in Bruxer versus Non-Bruxer Patients: A Retrospective Study, Materials, 15, 3, (2022); Lan, Tinghsun, Fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crowns in implant prostheses in patients with bruxism, Materials, 12, 10, (2019); Spies, B.

Test case prioritization (TCP) is a critical factor in optimizing automated testing, which prioritizes potentially failed test cases and improves the efficiency of automated testing. In CI automated testing, the TCP is a continuous decision-making process that can be solved with reinforcement learning (RL). RL-based CITCP can continuously generate a TCP strategy for each CI development lifecycle, with the reward mechanism as the core. The reward mechanism consists of the reward function and the reward strategy. However, there are new challenges to RL-based CITCP in real-industry CI testing. With high-frequency iteration, the reward function is often calculated with a fixed length of historical information, ignoring the spatial characteristics of the current cycle. Therefore, the dynamic time window (DTW)-based reward function is proposed to perform the reward calculation, which adaptively adjusts the recent historical information range based on the integration cycle. Moreover, with low-failure testing, the reward strategy usually only rewards failure test cases, which creates a sparse reward problem in RL. To address this issue, the similarity-based reward strategy is proposed, which increases the reward objects of some passed test cases, similar to the failure test cases. The DTW-based reward function and the similarity-based reward strategy together constitute the proposed adaptive reward mechanism in RL-based CITCP. To validate the effectiveness of the adaptive reward mechanism, experimental verification is carried out on 13 industrial data sets. The experimental results show that the adaptive reward mechanism can improve the TCP effect, where the average NAPFD is maximally improved by 7.29%, the average Recall is maximally improved by 6.04% and the average TTF is improved by 6.81 positions with a maximum of 63.77. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Integration Testing; Reinforcement Learning; Reward Mechanism; Test Case Prioritization; Automation; Decision Making; Integration; Integration Testing; Life Cycle; Reinforcement Learning; Transmission Control Protocol; Automated Testing; Continuous Integration Testing; Continuous Integrations; Dynamic Time; Historical Information; Reinforcement Learnings; Reward Function; Reward Mechanism; Test Case; Test Case Prioritization; Iterative Methods","Automation; Decision making; Integration; Integration testing; Life cycle; Reinforcement learning; Transmission control protocol; Automated testing; Continuous integration testing; Continuous integrations; Dynamic time; Historical information; Reinforcement learnings; Reward function; Reward mechanism; Test case; Test case prioritization; Iterative methods","","","Cannizzo, Fabrizio, Pushing the boundaries of testing and continuous integration, pp. 501-505, (2008); Zhao, Yangyang, The impact of continuous integration on other software development practices: A large-scale empirical study, pp. 60-71, (2017); Cost Effective Techniques for Continuous Integration Testing, (2018); Haghighatkhah, Alireza, Test prioritization in continuous integration environments, Journal of Systems and Software, 146, pp. 80-98, (2018); Pinto, Gustavo Henrique Lima, Work practices and challenges in continuous integration: A survey with Travis CI users, Software - Practice and Experience, 48, 12, pp. 2223-2236, (2018); Hao, Dan, Test-case prioritization: achievements and challenges, Frontiers of Computer Science, 10, 5, pp. 769-777, (2016); Orellana, Gerardo, On the Differences between Unit and Integration Testing in the TravisTorrent Dataset, IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories, 0, pp. 451-454, (2017); Spieker, Helge, Reinforcement learning for automatic test case prioritization and selection in continuous integration, pp. 12-22, (2017); Reinforcement Learning State of the Art, (2012); Yang, Yang, A systematic study of reward for reinforcement learning based continuous integration testing, Journal of Systems and Software, 170, (2020)","","World Scientific","","","","","","02181940; 17936403","","ISEKE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195854058"

Due to the complexity of the process and the large number of influencing parameters, there are currently no automated methods that can be used without additional sensors to evaluate the shear force bond quality quantitatively and non-destructively with sufficiently high precision. For this reason, this paper presents a new methodology that uses machine learning to enable quantitative, non-destructive prediction of bond quality without additional sensors. For this purpose, a machine learning algorithm was developed that uses various machine data and process data from existing sensors to quantitatively predict the shear force of the bonded joint. In addition, features are extracted from process time series, such as current, power, and frequency of the ultrasonic generator as well as deformation during bonding. Of the total of 2,090 features considered, the number of features could be reduced to 26 by recursive feature elimination, while maintaining the prediction accuracy. By using optimized deep neural networks, on average, a prediction precision of the regression on the shear force of the source bond of over 89.6% R2-score and a mean absolute error of 241 cN can be achieved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond Quality; Machine Learning; Quality Prediction; Shear Force; Ultrasonic Wire Bonding; Deep Neural Networks; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Nanocomposites; Ultrasonic Testing; Wire; Automated Productions; Bond Quality; Machine Data; Machine-learning; Process Data; Process Machine; Quality Prediction; Shear Force; Ultrasonic Wire Bonding; Wire Bonds; Forecasting","Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nanocomposites; Ultrasonic testing; Wire; Automated productions; Bond quality; Machine data; Machine-learning; Process data; Process machine; Quality prediction; Shear force; Ultrasonic wire bonding; Wire bonds; Forecasting","","","Kao, Shengxiang, Deep Learning-Based Positioning Error Fault Diagnosis of Wire Bonding Equipment and an Empirical Study for IC Packaging, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 36, 4, pp. 619-628, (2023); Qualifizierung Der Kupfer Drahtbondtechnologie Fur Integrierte Leistungsmodule in Harschen Umgebungsbedingungen, (2018); Wire Bonding in Microelectronics, (1997); Feng, Wuwei, Wire bonding quality monitoring via refining process of electrical signal from ultrasonic generator, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 25, 3, pp. 884-900, (2011); Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (2022); Guan, Xiaodan, The optimization of wire bonding parameters and quality prediction model based on neural network, Advanced Materials Research, 542-543, pp. 976-980, (2012); Zhang, Dong, Monitoring wire bonding via time-frequency analysis of horn vibration, IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing, 26, 3, pp. 216-220, (2003); Ling, Shihfu, Real-time quality evaluation of wire bonding using input impedance, IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing, 29, 4, pp. 280-284, (2006); Arjmand, Elaheh, Predicting Lifetime of Thick Al Wire Bonds Using Signals Obtained from Ultrasonic Generator, IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology, 6, 5, pp. 814-821, (2016); Lindamood, Lindsey R., Investigation of monitoring methods for ultrasonic metal welding, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 11591, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333015; 02683768","","IJATE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197531340"

This variability masks important changes within the collected data that could be indicative of damage, and its removal has been shown to significantly improve structural anomaly detection. Temperature-based measurement interpretation approaches are employed to remove this variability, however they are typically knowledge-intensive processes and require significant data processing. Current thermal response prediction methodologies have been predominantly developed using simplistic methods of engineering informatics using data from laboratory experiments, with low-levels of available computing power and data storage capabilities, and have generally had limited application to real-world infrastructure. This study proposes the iterative regression-based thermal response prediction (IRBTRP) methodology that harnesses high-performance computing to optimise the thermal response regression models through: (i) advanced regression algorithms (e.g. support vector regression and artificial neural networks); and (ii) a grid-search that determines the optimal hyperparameters, defined as customisable variables that affect the prediction accuracy. The process of determining the optimal hyperparameters is automated and this enables the IRBTRP methodology to be easily applied across a wide range of applications. The measured thermal responses from a Laboratory Truss and the MX3D Bridge (the world's first structure to be produced using metal additive manufacturing) are accurately predicted, with average errors of 3.1% and 4.9% respectively, across unseen testing datasets. Accurate predictions are obtained for the testing period of the MX3D Bridge dataset despite significant differences in temperature conditions between the training and testing subperiods. The IRBTRP methodology can therefore facilitate more accurate and reliable temperature-based measurement interpretation for real-world infrastructure, such as to support damage detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Printing; Environmental And Operational Variability; Metal Additive Manufacturing; Regression Models; Temperature-based Structural Health Monitoring; Thermal Response Predictions; Additives; Anomaly Detection; Damage Detection; Data Handling; Digital Storage; Forecasting; Iterative Methods; Life Cycle; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Regression Analysis; Statistical Tests; Structural Health Monitoring; 3-d Printing; 3d-printing; Environmental And Operational Variability; Metal Additive Manufacturing; Metal Additives; Regression Modelling; Response Prediction; Temperature-based Structural Health Monitoring; Thermal Response; Thermal Response Prediction; 3d Printing","Additives; Anomaly detection; Damage detection; Data handling; Digital storage; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Machine learning; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Structural health monitoring; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Environmental and operational variability; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Regression modelling; Response prediction; Temperature-based structural health monitoring; Thermal response; Thermal response prediction; 3D printing","","","Brownjohn, James M.W., Structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure, Philosophical transactions.

The conventional tool wear monitoring approaches depend on features extracted from signals, which require sensitive signals and consistent tool wear. In practical scenarios, however, neither the sensitivity of collected signals to the tool wear status nor the consistency of the actual tool wear evolution is hard to meet the requirement of the tool condition monitoring algorithm, which greatly limit the wide spread of its industrial applications. To overcome this challenge, we propose an Auxiliary Input-enhanced Siamese Neural Network (AISNN) framework by incorporating a Siamese structure into the feature extraction part of a convolutional neural network (CNN), and introducing an auxiliary input to its nonlinear regression part. The Siamese structure, instead of extracting features directly from signals, distinguishes the difference between the features extracted from signals of the examined cut and the first cut, and uses this difference as the indicator of tool wear status. Moreover, the auxiliary input provides an additional feature that has heavy dependence on the tool wear, which enables the model learning the general wear evolution of the examined cutting tool. The effectiveness of the proposed AISNN framework is verified in a set of milling experiments where input signal is insensitive to the flank wear of cutting tool and different tools’ wear evolution exhibits obvious inconsistency. Compared to the traditional CNN, the proposed AISNN significantly improves the accuracy on the verification set from 63% to 95% and on the testing set from 50% to 81%. The results demonstrate that the AISNN framework achieves significant improvement in feature extraction and generalization ability. The proposed AISNN, as a universal framework, can empower most existing deep learning-based tool wear prediction methods, enhancing their robustness in handling insensitive signals and inconsistent wear evolution and thereby promoting more industrial applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auxiliary Input; Siamese Neural Network; Tool Wear Prediction; Condition Monitoring; Convolutional Neural Networks; Cutting Tools; Deep Learning; Extraction; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Wear Of Materials; Auxiliary Inputs; Features Extraction; Generalization Ability; Network Frameworks; Neural-networks; Siamese Neural Network; Tool Wear; Tool Wear Monitoring; Tool Wear Prediction; Wear Prediction; Feature Extraction","Condition monitoring; Convolutional neural networks; Cutting tools; Deep learning; Extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Wear of materials; Auxiliary inputs; Features extraction; Generalization ability; Network frameworks; Neural-networks; Siamese neural network; Tool wear; Tool wear monitoring; Tool wear prediction; Wear prediction; Feature extraction","","","Nouri, Mehdi, Real-time tool wear monitoring in milling using a cutting condition independent method, International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 89, pp. 1-13, (2015); Byrne, Gerald, Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) - The Status of Research and Industrial Application, CIRP Annals, 44, 2, pp. 541-567, (1995); D'Addona, Doriana M., ANN tool wear modelling in the machining of nickel superalloy industrial products, CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 4, 1, pp. 33-37, (2011); Denkena, Berend, Wear curve based online feature assessment for tool condition monitoring, Procedia CIRP, 88, pp. 312-317, (2020); Jemielniak, Krzysztof, Tool Condition Monitoring in Metal Cutting, Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, 183, pp. 45-74, (2019); Jantunen, E.

The purpose of this work is to study the possibility of using the diffraction-time technique of ultrasonic non-destructive testing together with a deep convolutional neural network to accurately determine the numerical value of the height of an operational crack. The methods used include the analytical method, classification method, functional method, statistical method, synthesis method, and others. The study found that an automated approach to measuring crack height, based on diffraction signals and the use of neural networks, significantly improved the quality and accuracy of non-destructive testing. Ultrasonic testing is one of the most common inspection methods for detecting service cracks and is considered to be the most effective. It allows for reliable detection of defects and determination of their size without destroying the product. The results of the study emphasize the high potential and efficiency of the method in analysing the data obtained and provide confirmation of its applicability for determining the condition of objects during ultrasonic inspection. The paper emphasizes that these technologies are particularly important and effective. It is noted that their widespread use in various industries, such as medicine, aviation, and machine learning, demonstrates their power in solving complex problems.

Throughout functioning, loosening of bolts and preload losses can lower a structure's capability to transport loads while maintaining security and longevity. Among the most intriguing areas in this subject is applying Artificial intelligence algorithms like deep learning (DL) to non-destructive assessment. This investigation intends to contribute to this work by examining the adoption of DL methods for a bolt-loosening diagnosis from laser ultrasonic wave data. Ultrasonic Wave Propagation Imager (UWPI) was used to construct a 3D ultrasonic wave dataset. Various methods for signal processing were then used to produce the processing statistics. The determined variance was computed for assessing the efficiency of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on various processing data sets employing a regression framework depending on a VGG-like framework. To further illustrate the durability of the suggested method, comparisons were made with different AI algorithms for regression. It was discovered as a result that the suggested strategy has possibilities for integrating DL methods and laser-generated ultrasound.

Our experiments involve training and testing the models on an expanded dataset of 1603 warehouse package images, reflecting a significant increase of 167.17 percent from our previous dataset of 600 images. The results showcase the robustness and versatility of Random Forest, which emerges as the optimal choice for package detection with an accuracy of 95.6 percent . While SVM was previously the best performer in our smaller dataset, it is now the third choice, illustrating that model scalability is a crucial factor in performance evaluation.

However, there remains untapped potential for advancing computer vision through deep learning in regression tasks. Design engineers across many disciplines use computer-aided design software to model their designs. These computer-integrated designs often require machinery for construction or fabrication. For many engineering designs, precision and tolerancing is essential for the proper function and performance of the design. The engineering process typically involves manual testing and parameter measurements to ensure the proper function of the design before it is marketed. However, training a neural network to automate these tests and provide accurate numeric estimates of system parameters without manual intervention can significantly increase efficiency and decrease the time to market for many products. This shift from manual to automated testing allows for a heightened focus on innovation and project development while minimizing the time and resource dedication for validation. This article outlines the implementation of CNN models designed to enhance the efficiency of manually validating engineered projects. Our approach involves utilizing computer-aided design simulation image captures as training data for our pipeline. We integrate a real-time color-filtering and fiducial rotation scaling normalization process on any fabricated design image. Through these pre-processing methods, our algorithm can perceive these images in a consistent manner with simulation images from the model training. Our current model is trained with only 1020 simulation images and achieves a 1.99% average training prediction error on this dataset after training. Before, our errors were a 10.51% average error in our initial model implementation and 3.63% in our second implementation. On our test set, consisting of six captured and preprocessed sample fabricated design images, our model achieves a 3.40% average prediction error. The performance of a regression label neural network of this nature depends largely on the amount and range of data and simulation scenarios considered. As we continue to expand our training dataset through an optimized pipeline, we anticipate a significant improvement in model performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Vision; Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Deep Learning; Engineering Design; Fabrication; Simulation; Validation; Automatic Testing; Deep Neural Networks; Design For Testability; Integrated Circuit Design; Machine Design; Structural Dynamics; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Design Validation; Engineering Design; Neural-networks; Performance; Simulation; Simulation Images; Validation; Precision Engineering","Automatic testing; Deep neural networks; Design for testability; Integrated circuit design; Machine design; Structural dynamics; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Design validation; Engineering design; Neural-networks; Performance; Simulation; Simulation images; Validation; Precision engineering","","","Sharma, Mithun, Validating a destructive measurement system using Gauge R&R - A case study, Engineering Management in Production and Services, 11, 4, pp. 34-42, (2019); Chen, Yunhao, Multi-resolution segmentation parameters optimization and evaluation for VHR remote sensing image based on meanNSQI and discrepancy measure, Journal of Spatial Science, 66, 2, pp. 253-278, (2021); Cira, Calimanut Ionut, Convolutional Neural Networks Adapted for Regression Tasks: Predicting the Orientation of Straight Arrows on Marked Road Pavement Using Deep Learning and Rectified Orthophotography, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 18, (2023); Migalin, M.

Therefore, Test Case Prioritization (TCP) is crucial for enhancing the regression testing efficiency of CI. TCP methods aim to optimize regression testing by ordering test cases to effectively cover new code changes and their potential side effects and to maximize early fault detection. Traditional prioritization processes use diverse data sources, including code coverage analysis, test execution history, and domain-specific features. Heuristic-based or code-coverage-driven prioritization techniques may not be sufficient for accurate results in a rapidly changing environment. For this reason, there has been a significant shift towards employing Machine Learning (ML) techniques in TCP in recent years to harness the vast and complex datasets generated by CI practices. ML-based TCP approaches integrate multifaceted test case features from various sources to enhance the accuracy of test case prioritization. This trend reflects a broader movement towards data-driven decisionmaking in software testing, offering the potential to significantly reduce the regression testing burden by tailoring test suites more effectively to the needs of each software build, thereby saving time and resources while maintaining or improving the software quality. Recent studies have shown that the ML-based methods used in TCP can be categorized into four groups: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Codebases for software projects can be changed rapidly by introducing new feature distributions into the CI systems. We analyzed a Java application's CI and version control system (VCS) history data received from the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) [1], [6], [7]. The frequent inclusion of new test suites introduced new patterns into the dataset properties. To keep up with these changes, ML models require frequent re-training on old and new datasets to maintain high accuracy on new data. The volume of the dataset tends to increase with time as more data becomes available. Frequent re-training of ML models on the entire dataset is computationally costly and requires extensive storage. Reinforcement Learning focuses on finding the best solution through reward maximization [2] and restricts the learning goal. Learning incrementally from new non-stationary data without requiring an old dataset to solve this TCP problem. Continual Learning (CL) or life-long learning/ incremental learning adapts to changes without needing old training samples. While CL has recently been studied in several works for different domains, we could not find effective research on implementing CL in the TCP domain. Given the dynamic environment of software testing, we apply CL in industrial test case prioritization is critical for maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of software testing processes in dynamic environments. However, modifying ML models on new datasets may introduce other problems, such as catastrophic forgetting. This can occur when the model is trained on a new distribution, and the model weights change drastically. Different strategies have been suggested to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in CL. This abstract discusses the integration of pre-training and replay-based continual learning methods to enhance test case prioritization. Pre-trainingbased continual learning leverages the strong representation of pre-training models on a large dataset. This approach helps initialize the model with a broad understanding, which can be further incrementally trained to accommodate new tasks without significant performance loss on previous tasks. The dataset we obtained from IBM has a few years of test execution data for the CI and VCS. The model can be trained using a large volume of data for the pre-training method. Replay-based continual learning, however, involves retaining a small buffer of old training samples. This strategy includes a small fraction of old samples with a new dataset while incrementally training the model, enabling it to maintain its performance on older tasks by reinforcing the previous learning. Integrating pre-training and replay-based methods is most effective in the literature [3]. Pre-training provides a solid foundation for generic knowledge; replay-based methods complement this by continuously reinforcing past learning, ensuring that the adaptation to new tasks does not come at the expense of previously acquired knowledge. Several design choices leverage the benefits of this combined method. The frequency of incremental training on new datasets is an important design decision. This frequency can be timedriven or property-driven. Experimental work will guide the decision on incremental training frequency. Next, in replay-based approaches, the memory buffer size, number of old samples, and criteria for old sample selection are some of the decision parameters. In addition, a small buffer memory requires effective management in terms of data-retaining strategies. The empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of this integrated approach. Hu et al. [4] introduced prioritized experience replay in continual learning, emphasizing the selection of representative experiences to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Similarly, Merlin et al. [5] provided practical recommendations for replay-based continual learning methods, highlighting the importance of memory size and data augmentation in enhancing the performance. We will conduct detailed investigations to determine the optimal values for these decision parameters. For time-based frequency, we will experiment at different intervals, such as weekly, every ten or 15 days, monthly, three months, and six months of incremental training. Property-based choices can be new test suite additions, significant changes in test suites, and an increase or decrease in the test case failure rate. Similarly, for the replay-based method, samples can be selected from each incremental training dataset; the selection can be random or property-based. For example, an even distribution of passed or failed samples could be selected to avoid overfitting. In conclusion, integrating pretraining and replay-based continual learning methods presents a promising research direction for enhancing large-scale test case prioritization in CI. Future research should explore different strategies to maximize the benefits of continual learning in test case prioritization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catastrophic Forgetting; Continual Learning; Experience Replay; Pretraining; Test Case Prioritization; Computer Software Selection And Evaluation; Integration Testing; Java Programming Language; Negative Bias Temperature Instability; Problem Oriented Languages; Unsupervised Learning; Catastrophic Forgetting; Continual Learning; Continuous Integrations; Experience Replay; Incremental Training; Pre-training; Regression Testing; Software Testings; Test Case; Test Case Prioritization; Reinforcement Learning","Computer software selection and evaluation; Integration testing; Java programming language; Negative bias temperature instability; Problem oriented languages; Unsupervised learning; Catastrophic forgetting; Continual learning; Continuous integrations; Experience replay; Incremental training; Pre-training; Regression testing; Software testings; Test case; Test case prioritization; Reinforcement learning","","","Proceedings of the 31st Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2021); Abel, David, A Definition of Continual Reinforcement Learning, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, (2023); Wang, Liyuan, A Comprehensive Survey of Continual Learning: Theory, Method and Application, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 46, 8, pp. 5362-5383, (2024); Hu, Guannan, Prioritized Experience Replay for Continual Learning, pp. 16-20, (2021); Merlin, Gabriele, Practical Recommendations for Replay-Based Continual Learning Methods, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13374 LNCS, pp. 548-559, (2022); Proceedings of the 32nd Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, (2022); Mamata, Rezwana, Test Case Prioritization using Transfer Learning in Continuous Integration Environments, pp. 191-200, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2024 IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops, ICSTW 2024","","Toronto; ON","202743","","9798350344790","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206011625"

Various Test Input Generators (TIGs) have been proposed to generate misbehavior-inducing test inputs. However, the lack of validity checking in TIGs often results in the generation of invalid inputs (i.e., out of the learned distribution), leading to unreliable testing. To save the effort of manually checking the validity and improve test efficiency, it is important to assess the effectiveness and reliability of automated validators. In this study, we comprehensively assess four automated Input Validators (IV s), Our findings show that the accuracy of IVs ranges from 49% to 77%. Distance-based IVs generally outperform reconstruction-based and density-based IVs for both classification and regression tasks. Based on the findings, we enhance existing testing frameworks by incorporating distribution awareness through joint optimization. The results demonstrate our framework leads to a 2 % to 10% increase in the number of valid inputs, which establishes our method as an effective technique for valid test input generation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; Deep Learning; Input Validation; Software Testing; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Anomaly Detection; Comprehensive Testing; Deep Learning; Distance-based; Input Validation; Misbehaviour; Neural-networks; Software Testings; Test Efficiency; Test Inputs; Input Output Programs","Deep reinforcement learning; Anomaly detection; Comprehensive testing; Deep learning; Distance-based; Input validation; Misbehaviour; Neural-networks; Software testings; Test efficiency; Test inputs; Input output programs","","","Cireşan, Dan Claudiu, Multi-column deep neural networks for image classification, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3642-3649, (2012); Hinton, Geoffrey E., Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition: The shared views of four research groups, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29, 6, pp. 82-97, (2012); Cireşan, Dan Claudiu, Deep neural networks segment neuronal membranes in electron microscopy images, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 4, pp. 2843-2851, (2012); Zhou, Husheng, Deepbillboard: Systematic physical-world testing of autonomous driving systems, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 347-358, (2020); Pei, Kexin, DeepXplore: Automated Whitebox Testing of Deep Learning Systems, pp. 1-18, (2017); Kang, Sungmin, SINVAD: Search-based Image Space Navigation for DNN Image Classifier Test Input Generation, pp. 521-528, (2020); Zhang, Mengshi, Deeproad: GaN-based metamorphic testing and input validation framework for autonomous driving systems, pp. 132-142, (2018); Kong, Zelun, PhysGAN: Generating Physical-World-Resilient Adversarial Examples for Autonomous Driving, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 14242-14251, (2020); Jana, Suman, DeepTest: Automated testing of deep-neural-network-driven autonomous cars, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 2018-May, (2018); Sun, Youcheng, DeepConcolic: Testing and debugging deep neural networks, pp. 111-114, (2019)","Shahriar, H.; Ohsaki, H.; Sharmin, M.; Towey, D.; Majumder, AKM.J.A.; Hori, Y.; Yang, J.-J.; Takemoto, M.; Sakib, N.; Banno, R.; Ahamed, S.I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","48th IEEE Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2024","","Osaka","202071","","9798350376968","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204061860"

This paper proposes a new approach to design validation regression testing based on a reinforcement learning technique guided by tasks expressed in a formal logic specification language (TLTL) and the progress made in completing these tasks. This requires no prior knowledge of machine learning to train testing bots, is naturally interpretable and debuggable, and produces dense reward functions without the need for reward shaping. We investigate the validity of our strategy by comparing it to an imitation baseline in experiments organized around three use cases of typical scenarios in commercial video games on a 3D stealth testing environment created in Unity. For each scenario, we analyze the agents&#x0027; reactivity to modifications in common assets to accommodate design needs in other sections&#x00A0;of the game, and their ability to report unexpected gameplay variations.

Due to the increase in diseases that threaten human life, such as epidemics and cancer, more attention has been paid to research in this field. Especially in the field of biomedical image processing, very successful results have been obtained in recent years with the use of deep learning methods. For this study, MR images are utilized to diagnose brain tumors. To assist doctors and radiologists in automatic brain tumor diagnosis and to overcome the need for manual diagnosis, a brain MR image automated classification system is being developed. The data used in the study are open access data obtained from the Kaggle library. This paper presents a novel approach for classifying brain MR images utilizing a dataset of 7022 MR images. To give an unbiased evaluation of the dataset, it is divided into a 40% test and 60% training set. Respectively, VGG, ResNet, DenseNet and SqueezeNet architectures are trained and used for feature extraction from brain MRI images. In order to classify the extracted features, machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear Regression Analysis) are applied first, then an ensemble learning method is applied and the best validation method is selected. In addition, parameter optimization is applied to the trained CNN algorithms. In order to develop the proposed methods, the Python software program was used in the training and testing phases of the models, and the classification success rates were mutually evaluated. Among the results found, it can see that the ResNet architecture reached 100% accuracy. The data obtained as a result of the study were compared with the results of similar studies. In conclusion, the techniques and methods applied highlight their effectiveness in accurately classifying brain MRI images and their potential to improve diagnostic capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain Tumor; Classification; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Image Processing","","","","Mathew, Amitha, Deep learning techniques: an overview, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1141, pp. 599-608, (2021); Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D., Extracting Possibly Representative COVID-19 Biomarkers from X-ray Images with Deep Learning Approach and Image Data Related to Pulmonary Diseases, Journal of Medical and Biological Engineering, 40, 3, pp. 462-469, (2020); Akgül, İsmail, Covid-19 detection on x-ray images using a deep learning architecture, Journal of Engineering Research (Kuwait), 11, 2, pp. 15-26, (2023); Younis, Ayesha, Brain Tumor Analysis Using Deep Learning and VGG-16 Ensembling Learning Approaches, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 14, (2022); Gurkahraman, Kali, Brain tumors classification with deep learning using data augmentation, Journal of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Gazi University, 36, 2, pp. 997-1011, (2021); Noreen, Neelum, A Deep Learning Model Based on Concatenation Approach for the Diagnosis of Brain Tumor, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 55135-55144, (2020); Kazdal, Seda, Computer-aided detection of brain tumors using image processing techniques, pp. 863-866, (2015); International Journal of Advanced Computer Research, (2012); Aleid, Adham, Artificial Intelligence Approach for Early Detection of Brain Tumors Using MRI Images, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 6, (2023); Sultan, Hossam H., Multi-Classification of Brain Tumor Images Using Deep Neural Network, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 69215-69225, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192528413"

Semantic analysis is the computer analysis of language to derive connections, meaning, and context from words and sentences. In English language learning, dynamic content generation entails developing instructional materials that adjust to the specific requirements of each student, delivering individualized and contextually appropriate information to boost understanding and engagement. To tailor instructional materials to the various requirements of students, dynamic content creation is essential in English language learning (ELL). This work is a unique method for automatic and adaptive content production in ELL that uses Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) together. The suggested approach uses BERT enabling content selection, adaption, and adaptive educational content production, and GRU for semantic extraction of features and contextual information captured from textual input. The article presents a novel approach to creating automated and adaptable educational tools for ELL that uses GRU for semantic feature extraction. Using persuasive essays collected in the PERSUADE 2.0 corpus annotated with discourse components and competency scores, this is an extensive dataset. After extensive testing, this approach shows outstanding outcomes, with high accuracy reaching 97% when compared to the current Spiking Neural Network (SNN) &Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Convolutional Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (CBRNN). Python is used to implement the suggested work. The suggested strategy improves ELL engagement and understanding by providing individualized, contextually appropriate learning resources to each student. In addition, the flexibility of the system allows for real-time modifications to suit the changing needs and preferences of the learners. By providing instructors and students in a variety of educational contexts with a scalable and effective approach, this study advances automated content development in ELL. The model architecture will be improved in the future, along with the application's expansion into other domains outside of ELL and the investigation of new language aspects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Content Generation; English Language Learning; Gated Recurrent Unit; Semantic Analysis; Automation; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Extraction; Feature Extraction; Learning Systems; Logistic Regression; Python; Recurrent Neural Networks; Semantics; Bidirectional Encoder Representation From Transformer; Content Generation; Content Production; Dynamic Content; English Language Learning; English Languages; Gated Recurrent Unit; Instructional Materials; Language Learning; Semantic Analysis; Students","Automation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Python; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Content generation; Content production; Dynamic content; English language learning; English languages; Gated recurrent unit; Instructional materials; Language learning; Semantic analysis; Students","","","Salloum, Said A., A Survey of Semantic Analysis Approaches, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1153 AISC, pp. 61-70, (2020); Al-Emran, Mostafa, The impact of knowledge management processes on information systems: A systematic review, International Journal of Information Management, 43, pp. 173-187, (2018); Yu, Zhonggen, Motivation, Learning Strategies, and Outcomes in Mobile English Language Learning, Asia-Pacific Education Researcher, 32, 4, pp. 545-560, (2023); Li, Yan, From semantics to pragmatics: where IS can lead in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, European Journal of Information Systems, 30, 5, pp. 569-590, (2021); Alshurideh, Muhammad Turki, Understanding the quality determinants that influence the intention to use the mobile learning platforms: A practical study, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies, 13, 11, pp. 157-183, (2019); Mhamdi, Chaker Ali, Text mining and analytics: A case study from news channels posts on Facebook, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 740, pp. 399-415, (2018); Diwan, Chaitali, AI-based learning content generation and learning pathway augmentation to increase learner engagement, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 4, (2023); Sentence Level Content Planning and Style Specification for Neural Text Generation, (2019); Onan, Aytuǧ, Sentiment analysis on massive open online course evaluations: A text mining and deep learning approach, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 29, 3, pp. 572-589, (2021); Stracke, Christian M., A systematic literature review on the quality of moocs, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021)","","Science and Information Organization","","","","","","21565570; 2158107X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192146179"

The main goal of the study is the development and testing of machine learning algorithms for automated detection of the initial stages of fires based on the analysis of multispectral images. Within the framework of this study, the capabilities of three popular machine learning methods: extreme gradient boosting, logistic regression, and vanilla convolutional neural network (vanilla CNN), are considered in the task of processing and interpreting multispectral images to predict and detect fires. XGBoost, as a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm, provides high processing speed and accuracy, logistic regression stands out for its simplicity and interpretability, while vanilla CNN uses the power of deep learning to analyze spatial and spectral data.

Early detection of cardiac disease is essential as it is the only way to reduce the overall death rate caused by the disease. The majority of methods for diagnosing heart disease are clinical and expert dependent, which renders them expensive and out of reach for the general public. In this era of digital health, numerous researchers and medical professionals have created a variety of computer-aided diagnosis systems by using various machine learning techniques: K-nearest neighbour, random forest, linear regression, naive bayes, neural network, support vector machine, and decision tree are a few examples. This paper proposes a highly automated, less expensive and timesaving diagnosis model of coronary heart disease using fuzzy logic system optimized by particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. The model has been applied to the heart patients dataset extracted from Kaggle with thirteen clinical factors. In the initial stage, the system makes use of fuzzy logic with mamdani type-1. Further, the study tunes and optimizes the rules and membership functions using two evolutionary algorithms and compare the results of these techniques through the experimental records, RMSE and cross-validation method. The experimental findings yield 0.3437 and 0.3547 RMSE along with validation of testing set having RMSE 0.367 and 0.369 using particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Comparison Analysis; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Artificial Heart; Barium Compounds; Cardiology; Classifiers; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Computer Circuits; Decision Trees; Diseases; Fuzzy Logic; Fuzzy Neural Networks; Genetic Algorithms; Heart; Learning Systems; Medical Computing; Membership Functions; Random Forests; Statistical Tests; Support Vector Machines; Comparison Analysis; Coronary Heart Disease; Heart Disease Diagnosis; Hybrid Approach; Machine-learning; Means Square Errors; Neural-networks; Optimization And Genetic Algorithms; Particle Swarm Genetic Algorithms; Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm; Mean Square Error","Artificial heart; Barium compounds; Cardiology; Classifiers; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer circuits; Decision trees; Diseases; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Heart; Learning systems; Medical computing; Membership functions; Random forests; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Comparison analysis; Coronary heart disease; Heart disease diagnosis; Hybrid approach; Machine-learning; Means square errors; Neural-networks; Optimization and genetic algorithms; Particle swarm genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Mean square error","","","Tech Rep, (2016); Perret-Guillaume, Christine, Heart Rate as a Risk Factor for Cardiovascular Disease, Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, 52, 1, pp. 6-10, (2009); Tech Rep, (2019); Sarker, Iqbal H., Machine Learning: Algorithms, Real-World Applications and Research Directions, SN Computer Science, 2, 3, (2021); Ephzibah, E.

Lead poisoning is very much preventable with adequate and timely action. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that contribute to maternal BLL and minimise them to reduce the transfer to the foetus. Literacy and awareness related to its impact are low and the clinical establishment for biological monitoring of blood lead level (BLL) is low, costly, and time-consuming. A significant contribution to an infant’s BLL load is caused by maternal lead transfer during pregnancy. This acts as the first pathway to the infant’s lead exposure. The social and demographic information that includes lifestyle and environmental factors are key to maternal lead exposure. Results: We propose a novel approach to build a computational model framework that can predict lead toxicity levels in maternal blood using a set of sociodemographic features. To illustrate our proposed approach, maternal data comprising socio-demographic features and blood samples from the pregnant woman is collected, analysed, and modelled. The computational model is built that learns from the maternal data and then predicts lead level in a pregnant woman using a set of questionnaires that relate to the maternal’s social and demographic information as the first point of testing. The range of features identified in the built models can estimate the underlying function and provide an understanding of the toxicity level. Following feature selection methods, the 12-feature set obtained from the Boruta algorithm gave better prediction results (kNN = 76.84%, DT = 74.70%, and NN = 73.99%). Conclusion: The built prediction model can be beneficial in improving the point of care and hence reducing the cost and the risk involved. It is envisaged that in future, the proposed methodology will become a part of a screening process to assist healthcare experts at the point of evaluating the lead toxicity level in pregnant women. Women screened positive could be given a range of facilities including preliminary counselling to being referred to the health centre for further diagnosis. Steps could be taken to reduce maternal lead exposure; hence, it could also be possible to mitigate the infant’s lead exposure by reducing transfer from the pregnant woman. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boruta Algorithm; Data Analytics; Lead Toxicity; Machine Learning; Maternal Lead Exposure; Prediction Modelling; Sociodemographic; Alcohol; Aluminum; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lead; Nitric Acid; Perchloric Acid; Water; Optima 8000; Alcohol; Aluminum; Fuel; Glass; Ground Water; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lead; Nitric Acid; Perchloric Acid; Water; Accuracy; Adaptive Boosting; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Bayesian Learning; Blood Sampling; Boruta Algorithm; Calcium Deficiency; Calibration; Child; Classification And Regression Tree; Clinical Assessment; Computational Modelling Framework; Computer Model; Cross Validation; Data Collection Method; Decision Tree; Education; Environmental Factor; Expert System; Exposure; Family; Feature Selection; Female; Gastrointestinal Disease; Hand Exposure; Headache; Healthcare Expert; Home Exposure; Household; Human; Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry; Infant; K Nearest Neighbor; Lead Blood Level; Lead Poisoning; Lethargy; Limit Of Detection; Machine Learning; Maternal Smoking; Maternal Lead Exposure; Multinomial Logistic Regression; Multivariate Analysis; Newborn; Occupational Exposure; Point Of Care Testing; Prediction; Questionnaire; Reverse Osmosis; Smoking; Sociodemographics; Support Vector Machine; Univariate Analysis","alcohol; aluminum; fuel; glass; ground water; hydrogen peroxide; lead; nitric acid; perchloric acid; water; accuracy; adaptive boosting; adolescent; adult; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; Bayesian learning; blood sampling; boruta algorithm; calcium deficiency; calibration; child; classification and regression tree; clinical assessment; computational modelling framework; computer model; cross validation; data collection method; decision tree; education; environmental factor; expert system; exposure; family; feature selection; female; gastrointestinal disease; hand exposure; headache; healthcare expert; home exposure; household; human; inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry; infant; k nearest neighbor; lead blood level; lead poisoning; lethargy; limit of detection; machine learning; maternal smoking; maternal lead exposure; multinomial logistic regression; multivariate analysis; newborn; occupational exposure; point of care testing; prediction; questionnaire; reverse osmosis; smoking; sociodemographics; support vector machine; univariate analysis","","alcohol, 64-17-5; aluminum, 7429-90-5; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; nitric acid, 7697-37-2; perchloric acid, 7601-90-3; water, 7732-18-5","Rocha, Angelica, Neurotoxicity of low-level lead exposure: History, mechanisms of action, and behavioral effects in humans and preclinical models, NeuroToxicology, 73, pp. 58-80, (2019); Roberts, David J., Lead exposure in children, BMJ, (2022); Lead Poisoning World Health Organization, (2023); Taylor, Caroline M., Dietary Patterns Are Not Consistently Associated with Variability in Blood Lead Concentrations in Pregnant British Women, Journal of Nutrition, 149, 6, pp. 1027-1036, (2019); Whitehead, Latoria S., Childhood Lead Poisoning: A Perpetual Environmental Justice Issue?, Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, 25, pp. S115-S120, (2019); Ericson, Bret, Blood lead levels in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review, The Lancet Planetary Health, 5, 3, pp. e145-e153, (2021); Grantham-McGregor, Sally M., Developmental potential in the first 5 years for children in developing countries, The Lancet, 369, 9555, pp. 60-70, (2007); Toxic Truth Childrens Exposure to Lead Pollution Undermines A Generation of Future Potential, (2020); Wright, John Paul, Association of prenatal and childhood blood lead concentrations with criminal arrests in early adulthood, PLOS Medicine, 5, 5, pp. 0732-0739, (2008); Aizer, Anna, LEAD AND JUVENILE DELINQUENCY: NEW EVIDENCE FROM LINKED BIRTH, SCHOOL, AND JUVENILE DETENTION RECORDS, Review of Economics and Statistics, 101, 4, pp. 575-587, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","20472501","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177196999"

One such challenge pertains to continuous integration testing, which is highly time-constrained, and generates a large amount of data coming from iterative code commits and test runs. In such a setting, we can use plentiful test data for training machine learning predictors to identify test cases able to speed up the detection of regression bugs introduced during code integration. However, different machine learning models can have different fault prediction performance depending on the context and the parameters of continuous integration testing, for example, variable time budget available for continuous integration cycles, or the size of test execution history used for learning to prioritize failing test cases. Existing studies on test case prioritization rarely study both of these factors, which are essential for the continuous integration practice. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparison of the fault prediction performance of machine learning approaches that have shown the best performance on test case prioritization tasks in the literature. We evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting fault-detecting tests for different values of the continuous integration time budget and with different lengths of test history used for training the classifiers. In evaluation, we use real-world and augmented industrial datasets from a continuous integration practice. The results show that different machine learning models have different performance for different size of test history used for model training and for different time budgets available for test case execution.

Often trained with data from a single glaucoma clinic, they report impressive performance on internal test sets, but tend to struggle in generalizing to external sets. This performance drop can be attributed to data shifts in glaucoma prevalence, fundus camera, and the definition of glaucoma ground truth. In this study, we confirm that a previously described regression network for glaucoma referral (G-RISK) obtains excellent results in a variety of challenging settings. Thirteen different data sources of labeled fundus images were utilized. The data sources include two large population cohorts (Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study, BMES and German Gutenberg Health Study, GHS) and 11 publicly available datasets (AIROGS, ORIGA, REFUGE1, LAG, ODIR, REFUGE2, GAMMA, RIM-ONEr3, RIM-ONE DL, ACRIMA, PAPILA). To minimize data shifts in input data, a standardized image processing strategy was developed to obtain 30° disc-centered images from the original data. A total of 149,455 images were included for model testing. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for BMES and GHS population cohorts were at 0.976 [95% CI: 0.967–0.986] and 0.984 [95% CI: 0.980–0.991] on participant level, respectively. At a fixed specificity of 95%, sensitivities were at 87.3% and 90.3%, respectively, surpassing the minimum criteria of 85% sensitivity recommended by Prevent Blindness America. AUC values on the eleven publicly available data sets ranged from 0.854 to 0.988. These results confirm the excellent generalizability of a glaucoma risk regression model trained with homogeneous data from a single tertiary referral center. Further validation using prospective cohort studies is warranted. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Image Processing; Large Dataset; Ophthalmology; Classification Models; Data-source; Datum Shifts; Fundus Camera; Fundus Image; Ground Truth; Large Population; Performance; Regression Modelling; Test Sets; Population Statistics; Age Related Macular Degeneration; Area Under The Curve; Article; Automation; Benchmarking; Central Corneal Thickness; Clinical Evaluation; Cohort Analysis; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Disease Severity; Eye Disease; Glaucoma; Glaucoma Grading From Multi Modality Image; Glaucoma Risk Regression Model; Human; Image Processing; Image Quality; Image Segmentation; Intraocular Pressure; Large Scale Attention Based Glaucoma Detection Database; Major Clinical Study; Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition; Ophthalmoscopy; Optic Disk; Prediction; Prevalence; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Regression Model; Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge; Retinal Image Databases For Optic Nerve Evaluation; Sensitivity And Specificity; Tertiary Care Center; Vertical Cup-to-disc Ratio","Deep learning; Image processing; Large dataset; Ophthalmology; Classification models; Data-source; Datum shifts; Fundus camera; Fundus image; Ground truth; Large population; Performance; Regression modelling; Test sets; Population statistics; age related macular degeneration; area under the curve; Article; automation; benchmarking; central corneal thickness; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; eye disease; glaucoma; glaucoma grading from multi modality image; glaucoma risk regression model; human; image processing; image quality; image segmentation; intraocular pressure; large scale attention based glaucoma detection database; major clinical study; ocular disease intelligent recognition; ophthalmoscopy; optic disk; prediction; prevalence; receiver operating characteristic; regression model; retinal fundus glaucoma challenge; retinal image databases for optic nerve evaluation; sensitivity and specificity; tertiary care center; vertical cup-to-disc ratio","","","Tham, Yihchung, Global prevalence of glaucoma and projections of glaucoma burden through 2040: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Ophthalmology, 121, 11, pp. 2081-2090, (2014); Mitchell, Paul G., Prevalence of open-angle glaucoma in Australia: The blue mountains eye study, Ophthalmology, 103, 10, pp. 1661-1669, (1996); Topouzis, Fotis, Prevalence of Open-Angle Glaucoma in Greece: The Thessaloniki Eye Study, American Journal of Ophthalmology, 144, 4, pp. 511-e1, (2007); Budenz, Donald Lyle, Prevalence of glaucoma in an urban west african population: The tema eye survey, JAMA Ophthalmology, 131, 5, pp. 651-658, (2013); Liang, Yuanbo, Prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma in a rural adult chinese population: The Handan eye study, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science, 52, 11, pp. 8250-8257, (2011); Burr, J.

Furthermore, the ratio of rock minerals could be determined by combining PEF log with other well logs. However, PEF logs could be missing in some cases such as in old well logs and wells drilled with barite-based mud. Therefore, developing models for estimating missing PEF logs is essential in those circumstances. In this work, we developed various machine learning models to predict PEF values using the following well logs as inputs: bulk density (RHOB), neutron porosity (NPHI), gamma ray (GR), compressional and shear velocity. The predictions of PEF values using adaptive-network-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) models have errors of about 16% and 14% average absolute percentage error (AAPE) in the testing dataset, respectively. Thus, a different approach was proposed that is based on the concept of automated machine learning. It works by automatically searching for the optimal model type and optimizes its hyperparameters for the dataset under investigation. This approach selected a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model for the accurate estimation of PEF values. The developed GPR model decreases the AAPE of the predicted PEF values in the testing dataset to about 10% AAPE. This error could be further decreased to about 2% by modeling the potential noise in the measurements using the GPR model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network (ann); Automated Learning; Fuzzy Logic; Gaussian Process Regression; Machine Learning Algorithms; Photoelectric Factor; Uncertainty Quantification; Well Logging; Atoms; Automation; Forecasting; Fuzzy Inference; Fuzzy Neural Networks; Gaussian Distribution; Gaussian Noise (electronic); Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Shear Flow; Statistical Tests; Uncertainty Analysis; Artificial Neural Network; Automated Learning; Fuzzy-logic; Gaussian Process Regression; Machine Learning Algorithms; Percentage Error; Photoelectric Factor; Photoelectrics; Uncertainty Quantifications; Well Logs; Errors","Atoms; Automation; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Shear flow; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Artificial neural network; Automated learning; Fuzzy-Logic; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning algorithms; Percentage error; Photoelectric factor; Photoelectrics; Uncertainty quantifications; Well logs; Errors","","","Theory Measurement and Interpretation of Well Logs, (1994); Well Logging for Earth Scientists, (1987); Well Logging and Interpretation Techniques, (1982); Asoodeh, Mojtaba, The prediction of photoelectric factor, formation true resistivity, and formation water saturation from petrophysical well log data: A committee neural network approach, Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, 37, 5, pp. 557-566, (2015); Akinnikawe, Oyewande, Synthetic well log generation using machine learning techniques, (2018); Amir, Syed Muhammad R.R., Integration of petrophysical log data with computational intelligence forthe development of a lithology predictor, (2020); Merembayev, Timur, A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting Lithofacies: Case Studies from Norway and Kazakhstan, Energies, 14, 7, (2021); Hossain, Touhid Mohammad, Machine learning in electrofacies classification and subsurface lithology interpretation: A rough set theory approach, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 17, (2020); Miah, Mohammad Islam, Log data-driven model and feature ranking for water saturation prediction using machine learning approach, Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 194, (2020); Hadavimoghaddam, Fahimeh, Prediction of water saturation from well log data by machine learning algorithms: Boosting and super learner, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 9, 6, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168122822"

Although various approaches of software testing have shown to be very promising in revealing defects in software, some of them lack automation or are partly automated which increases the testing time, the manpower needed, and overall software testing costs. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully employed in complex testing tasks such as game testing, regression testing, and test case prioritization to automate the process and provide continuous adaptation. Practitioners can employ DRL by implementing from scratch a DRL algorithm or using a DRL framework. DRL frameworks offer well-maintained implemented state-of-the-art DRL algorithms to facilitate and speed up the development of DRL applications. Developers have widely used these frameworks to solve problems in various domains including software testing. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that empirically evaluates the effectiveness and performance of implemented algorithms in DRL frameworks. Moreover, some guidelines are lacking from the literature that would help practitioners choose one DRL framework over another. In this paper, therefore, we empirically investigate the applications of carefully selected DRL algorithms (based on the characteristics of algorithms and environments) on two important software testing tasks: test case prioritization in the context of Continuous Integration (CI) and game testing. For the game testing task, we conduct experiments on a simple game and use DRL algorithms to explore the game to detect bugs. Results show that some of the selected DRL frameworks such as Tensorforce outperform recent approaches in the literature. To prioritize test cases, we run extensive experiments on a CI environment where DRL algorithms from different frameworks are used to rank the test cases. We find some cases where our DRL configurations outperform the implementation of the baseline. Our results show that the performance difference between implemented algorithms in some cases is considerable, motivating further investigation. Moreover, empirical evaluations on some benchmark problems are recommended for researchers looking to select DRL frameworks, to make sure that DRL algorithms perform as intended. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Game Testing; Reinforcement Learning; Software Testing; Test Case Prioritization; Application Programs; Deep Learning; Defects; Integration Testing; Program Debugging; Game Testing; Learning Frameworks; Performance; Reinforcement Learning Algorithms; Reinforcement Learnings; Software Products; Software Testings; Test Case; Test Case Prioritization; Testing Time; Reinforcement Learning","Application programs; Deep learning; Defects; Integration testing; Program debugging; Game testing; Learning frameworks; Performance; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Software products; Software testings; Test case; Test case prioritization; Testing time; Reinforcement learning","","","undefined, (2016); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2022); Tensorflow Large Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, (2015); Adamo, David, Reinforcement learning for android GUI testing, pp. 2-8, (2018); Alshahwan, Nadia, Deploying search based software engineering with sapienz at facebook, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11036 LNCS, pp. 3-45, (2018); Arcuri, Andrea, A Hitchhiker's guide to statistical tests for assessing randomized algorithms in software engineering, Software Testing Verification and Reliability, 24, 3, pp. 219-250, (2014); IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, (2021); Bahrpeyma, Fouad, An adaptive RL based approach for dynamic resource provisioning in Cloud virtualized data centers, Computing, 97, 12, pp. 1209-1234, (2015); Bergdahl, Joakim, Augmenting Automated Game Testing with Deep Reinforcement Learning, IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG, 2020-August, pp. 600-603, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","15737616; 13823256","","ESENF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168682357"

This work proposes a novel method for 3D delamination identification in sandwich composite structures. Sandwich structures are prone to damage that is difficult to detect, necessitating efficient and complex inspection techniques. In this context, automated structural health monitoring techniques are of great impact and importance in engineering. Such techniques use data obtained by sensors to identify damage to the structure. In this paper, a complete methodology for damage (delamination) identification in sandwich composite structures using machine learning is proposed. The damage was parameterized in two different ways: as parametrized two- and three-dimensional ellipses, and it was considered in three different groups: the core, interface, and skin. The modal data, obtained by the finite element method, was used to train several machine learning models in order to classify the location of the damage. In addition, modal dataset was also used to train artificial neural network regression models for damage localization and sizing. Both classification and regression strategies showed substantial results, and the models proved to be robust enough to identify a wide variety of damages. Results showed that classification models correctly identified the damage on the composite skin and incorrectly identified the interface core-skin damage. The regression model proved to be reliable in identifying an approximate location with an average accuracy of 85%. However, damage sizing is still a challenge to predict based only on modal datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Modal Testing; Sandwich Structures; Structural Health Monitoring; Composite Structures; Damage Detection; Machine Learning; Modal Analysis; Neural Networks; Regression Analysis; Sandwich Structures; Structure (composition); Composites Structures; Damage Detection And Identification; Data Driven; Delamination Identification; Machine Learning Techniques; Machine-learning; Modal Testings; Regression Modelling; Sandwich Composites; Structural Systems; Structural Health Monitoring","Composite structures; Damage detection; Machine learning; Modal analysis; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Sandwich structures; Structure (composition); Composites structures; Damage detection and identification; Data driven; Delamination identification; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Modal testings; Regression modelling; Sandwich composites; Structural systems; Structural health monitoring","","","Process Modeling in Composites Manufacturing, (2003); undefined; undefined, (2018); Braun, Carlos E., Variations of Ant Colony Optimization for the solution of the structural damage identification problem, Procedia Computer Science, 51, 1, pp. 875-884, (2015); Carlsson, Leif A., Structural and failure mechanics of sandwich composites, Solid Mechanics and its Applications, 121, pp. 1-399, (2011); Di Lorenzo, Emilio, Structural Health Monitoring strategies based on the estimation of modal parameters, Procedia Engineering, 199, pp. 3182-3187, (2017); Farrar, Charles R., An introduction to structural health monitoring, Philosophical transactions.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are widely used for its identification as they are non-invasive and have high temporal resolution. EEG signals may be captured using wearable devices but transmission of complete data from all channels is both battery and data consuming. Several studies on Schizophrenia have either used all channels or relied on sophisticated feature extraction algorithms to find the most relevant EEG channels for further processing. That too, however, needs data from all channels beforehand to identify the most relevant features. In this study, a publicly available multi-channel EEG signals dataset from the institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland is studied for an automated identification of Schizophrenia using only a subset of data from selected channels. To achieve this, we device a channel selection mechanism based on a rigorous performance analysis of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) while considering the individual EEG channels at different brain regions. The selected channels are combined, and we use a fusion of CNN and different machine learning (ML) classifiers to train the classification model. Our experiments show that a combination of three channels namely, T4, T3, and Cz achieves 90% and 98% accuracies on subject-based and non-subject based testing, respectively, using a hybridization of CNN and logistic regression (LR). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network (cnn); Electroencephalography (eeg); Logistic Regression; Schizophrenia; Biomedical Signal Processing; Brain; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Diseases; Electrophysiology; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Adverse Effect; Convolutional Neural Network; Electroencephalography; High Temporal Resolution; Logistics Regressions; Machine Learning Techniques; Mental Disorders; Neural Network Learning; Schizophrenia","Biomedical signal processing; Brain; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Electrophysiology; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Adverse effect; Convolutional neural network; Electroencephalography; High temporal resolution; Logistics regressions; Machine learning techniques; Mental disorders; Neural network learning; Schizophrenia","","","Lih Oh, Shu Lih, Deep convolutional neural network model for automated diagnosis of Schizophrenia using EEG signals, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 9, 14, (2019); Jahmunah, Vicnesh, Automated detection of schizophrenia using nonlinear signal processing methods, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 100, (2019); Shalbaf, Ahmad, Transfer learning with deep convolutional neural network for automated detection of schizophrenia from EEG signals, Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine, 43, 4, pp. 1229-1239, (2020); Devia, Christ, EEG Classification during Scene Free-Viewing for Schizophrenia Detection, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 27, 6, pp. 1193-1199, (2019); Siuly, Siuly, A computerized method for automatic detection of schizophrenia using EEG signals, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 28, 11, pp. 2390-2400, (2020); Subudhi, Asit Kumar, Automated approach for detection of ischemic stroke using Delaunay Triangulation in brain MRI images, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 103, pp. 116-129, (2018); Talo, Muhammed, Application of deep transfer learning for automated brain abnormality classification using MR images, Cognitive Systems Research, 54, pp. 176-188, (2019); Gudigar, Anjan, Application of multiresolution analysis for automated detection of brain abnormality using MR images: A comparative study, Future Generation Computer Systems, 90, pp. 359-367, (2019); Acharya, Rajendra U., Application of non-linear and wavelet based features for the automated identification of epileptic EEG signals, International Journal of Neural Systems, 22, 2, (2012); Acharya, Rajendra U., A novel depression diagnosis index using nonlinear features in EEG signals, European Neurology, 74, 1-2, pp. 79-83, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15662535","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144606442"

A core component of advancing cancer treatment research is assessing response to therapy. Doing so by hand, for example, as per RECIST or RANO criteria, is tedious and time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response information. Most notably, the prevalent response criteria often exclude lesions, the non-target lesions, altogether. We wish to assess change in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple, informative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Because genetic sub-types of cancer can be fairly specific and patient enrollment in therapy trials is often limited in number and accrual rate, we wish to make response assessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) is a novel radiology artificial intelligence (AI) optimization approach that performs well on small training sets. Here, we use a DNE parameter search to optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts progression versus regression of metastatic brain disease. We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training set. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression, while the other 25 image pairs constituted regression. We trained the parameters of a CNN via “mutations” that consisted of random CNN weight adjustments and evaluated mutation “fitness” as summed training set accuracy. We then incorporated the best mutations into the next generation’s CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000 generations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate testing set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression cases. DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy. DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy. We have thus shown that DNE can accurately classify brain metastatic disease progression versus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to full 3D volumes, and include the category of “no change.” We believe that an approach such as ours can ultimately provide a useful and informative complement to RANO/RECIST assessment and volumetric AI analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain Metastatic Disease; Cancer; Deep Neuroevolution; Clinical Research; Convolutional Neural Networks; Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Patient Treatment; Regression Analysis; Tumors; Well Testing; Brain Metastatic Disease; Cancer; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Neuroevolution; Disease Progression; Metastatic Disease; Neuro Evolutions; Small Training; Testing Sets; Training Sets; Image Enhancement; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain Tumor; Diagnostic Imaging; Disease Exacerbation; Human; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer","Clinical research; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Patient treatment; Regression analysis; Tumors; Well testing; Brain metastatic disease; Cancer; Convolutional neural network; Deep neuroevolution; Disease progression; Metastatic disease; Neuro evolutions; Small training; Testing sets; Training sets; Image enhancement; artificial intelligence; brain; brain tumor; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; human; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer","","","Zhang, James Y., Quantitative Improvement in Brain Tumor MRI Through Structured Reporting (BT-RADS), Academic Radiology, 27, 6, pp. 780-784, (2020); Gore, Ashwani, Institutional Implementation of a Structured Reporting System: Our Experience with the Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System, Academic Radiology, 26, 7, pp. 974-980, (2019); Weinberg, Brent D., Management-Based Structured Reporting of Posttreatment Glioma Response With the Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System, Journal of the American College of Radiology, 15, 5, pp. 767-771, (2018); Do, Richard Kinh Gian, Standardized Reporting of Oncologic Response: Making Every Report Count, Radiology: Imaging Cancer, 4, 4, (2022); Wen, Patrick Yung Chih, Response assessment in neuro-oncology clinical trials, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 35, 21, pp. 2439-2449, (2017); Hajnal, Joseph V., Detection of subtle brain changes using sub voxel registration and subtraction of serial mr images, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 19, 5, pp. 677-691, (1995); Freeborough, Peter A., Accurate registration of serial 3D MR brain images and its application to visualizing change in neurodegenerative disorders, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 20, 6, pp. 1012-1022, (1996); In Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (2021); Stember, Joseph Nathaniel, Deep Reinforcement Learning with Automated Label Extraction from Clinical Reports Accurately Classifies 3D MRI Brain Volumes, Journal of Digital Imaging, 35, 5, pp. 1143-1152, (2022); Adhya, Julie, Positive predictive value and stroke workflow outcomes using automated vessel density (RAPID-CTA) in stroke patients: One year experience, Neuroradiology Journal, 34, 5, pp. 476-481, (2021)","","Institute for Ionics","","","","","","08971889; 1618727X","","JDIME","36396839","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142154322"

Consequently, these strategies often elude game designers and quality control teams, who could otherwise use them to automate testing procedures. This paper extends our prior work by introducing “AI Behavior Graphs,” a visual toolkit designed to simplify the creation of behavior specifications for NPCs (Non-Player Characters). Our approach provides an intuitive graphical interface that enables designers to express their expectations for player-NPC interactions within a game level. These specifications are automatically translated into both Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Rabin automata, which can in turn be leveraged to dynamically generate reward functions during agent training. This not only expedites NPC development but also makes RL-based methodologies more accessible to a broader audience of game designers and quality assurance teams. Furthermore, it underscores a critical aspect of our approach: the ability to utilize these agents for playtesting game levels. This application ensures continuous validation of designer expectations throughout the development cycle, enhancing the overall game design process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Game Testing; Game-playing Ai; Reinforcement Learning; Temporal Logics; Visual Toolkit; Autonomous Agents; Decision Making; Game Design; Iterative Methods; Quality Assurance; Quality Control; Software Design; Software Testing; Specifications; Temporal Logic; Automated Game Testing; Behavior Graphs; Game Playing; Game Testing; Game-playing Ai; Games Designers; Non-player Character; Reinforcement Learnings; Reward Function; Visual Toolkit; Reinforcement Learning","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Game design; Iterative methods; Quality assurance; Quality control; Software design; Software testing; Specifications; Temporal logic; Automated game testing; Behavior graphs; Game playing; Game testing; Game-playing AI; Games designers; Non-player character; Reinforcement learnings; Reward function; Visual toolkit; Reinforcement learning","","","Gutierrez-Sanchez, Pablo, Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Logic Specifications for Regression Testing NPCs in Video Games, IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG, (2023); Gstf Journal on Computing Joc, (2013); Bergdahl, Joakim, Augmenting Automated Game Testing with Deep Reinforcement Learning, IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG, 2020-August, pp. 600-603, (2020); Ariyurek, Sinan, Automated Video Game Testing Using Synthetic and Humanlike Agents, IEEE Transactions on Games, 13, 1, pp. 50-67, (2021); Gutierrez-Sanchez, Pablo, Reinforcement Learning Methods to Evaluate the Impact of AI Changes in Game Design, pp. 10-17, (2021); Li, Xiao, Reinforcement learning with temporal logic rewards, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2017-September, pp. 3834-3839, (2017); Gutierrez-Sanchez, Pablo, Liquid Snake: a test environment for video game testing agents, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3305, (2022); Unity A General Platform for Intelligent Agents, (2018); Automata Theory and Its Applications, (2001); A Survey of Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Logic Rewards, (2020)","Shliakhovchuk, E.; Chover, M.","CEUR-WS","","2nd Congreso Espanol de Videojuegos, CEV 2023 - 2nd Spanish Video Games Congress","","Madrid","195886","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184150552"

It is called the ""Silent Thief of Sight"" because it has no symptoms in its early stages. A retinal fluid drainage imbalance causes elevated eye pressure. Over time, this pressure could damage the cells of the optic nerve that transmit visual data to the brain. Consequently, individuals with glaucoma can have progressive vision loss, eventually leading to total blindness if left untreated in the earliest stages. In recent years, there has been a rising interest in utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques for developing an efficient automated diagnosis system for analyzing the retina fundus images to assist optometrists in diagnosing glaucoma at the early stages and reducing the time, cost, and human errors. All these issues motivate us to suggest an automatic glaucoma screening system as decision support for ophthalmologists at the early stages. The system based on combination decisions comes from three different approaches. Each approach uses different kinds of features for analyzing images. The first approach extracts medical features using the YOLOv8 algorithm to detect the optic disc and cup, then classifies features using the logistic regression model. The second approach extracts texture features using deep wavelet scattering and then employs the long short-term memory layer and sigmoid function to classify features. The third approach extracts deep features using convolutional neural network and then employs the attention layer and sigmoid function to classify features. The proposed system attained average results in testing images for the REFUGE, RIM-ONE-DL, DRISHTI-GS1, and ORIGA datasets, 96.21% accuracy, 98.65% specificity, 83.13% recall, 92% precision, 87.34% F1- score, 97.5% area under curve, and the average time is 0.4 seconds for classifying each image. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn Classification; Deep Wavelet; Glaucoma; Medical Image Processing; Optic Disc Detection; Yolo","","","","Sharma, Ritika, Myocilin-associated glaucoma: A historical perspective and recent research progress, Molecular Vision, 27, pp. 480-493, (2021); Advances in Computational Intelligence Techniques, (2020); Sreng, Syna, Deep learning for optic disc segmentation and glaucoma diagnosis on retinal images, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 14, (2020); Pathan, Sumaiya, Automated segmentation and classifcation of retinal features for glaucoma diagnosis, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 63, (2021); Hemelings, Ruben, Accurate prediction of glaucoma from colour fundus images with a convolutional neural network that relies on active and transfer learning, Acta Ophthalmologica, 98, 1, pp. e94-e100, (2020); Mahum, Rabbia, A novel hybrid approach based on deep cnn to detect glaucoma using fundus imaging, Electronics (Switzerland), 11, 1, (2022); Zhou, Wei, Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation in Retinal Images for Glaucoma Diagnosis by Locally Statistical Active Contour Model with Structure Prior, Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine, 2019, (2019); Singh, Hardit, Rapid classification of glaucomatous fundus images, Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision, 38, 6, pp. 765-774, (2021); Pascal, Lucas, Multi-task deep learning for glaucoma detection from color fundus images, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Haider, Adnan, Exploring deep feature-blending capabilities to assist glaucoma screening, Applied Soft Computing, 133, (2023)","","Intelligent Network and Systems Society","","","","","","21853118; 2185310X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177681902"

It is the second most common type of cancer after the breast cancer seen in women. Detection of cervical cancer at the early stage is vital. Various screening methods like Pap smear, Colposcopy and HPV testing are carried out for the detection of cervical cancer. The possible screening techniques to diagnose cervical cancer include the visual inspection of the cervix (VIA), Pap smear examination (cytology), Colposcopy, Biopsy and HPV-DNA detection. All these techniques need the involvement of an expert doctor and/or pathologist. Also, a cancer diagnosis is a subjective process where the experience and training of pathologists are significant factors. Intelligent and automated screening systems will be helpful in such scenarios. This paper presents the methodology for cervical cancer prediction based on pap smear images. Pre-trained deep neural network models are used for feature extraction and different machine-learning (ML) models are trained on extracted features. In the proposed methodology, four pre-trained models such as Alexnet, Resnet-18, Resnet-50 and Googlenet are fine-tuned for feature extraction followed by the different ML algorithms. Among these simple logistic regression, the algorithms have performed best with the highest accuracy of 95.14% with the Alexnet pre-trained model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cervical Cancer; Computer-aided Diagnosis; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Pap Smear; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Cytology; Deep Neural Networks; Diseases; Extraction; Learning Systems; Abnormal Growth; Breast Cancer; Cancer Detection; Cervical Cancers; Deep Learning; Features Extraction; Learning Evaluations; Machine-learning; Pap Smear; Performances Evaluation; Feature Extraction; Algorithm; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Colposcopy; Cytology; Decision Tree; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Network; Feature Extraction; Female; Human; K Nearest Neighbor; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Papanicolaou Test; Random Forest; Residual Neural Network; Sensitivity And Specificity; Support Vector Machine; Uterine Cervix Cancer","Computer aided diagnosis; Cytology; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Extraction; Learning systems; Abnormal growth; Breast Cancer; Cancer detection; Cervical cancers; Deep learning; Features extraction; Learning evaluations; Machine-learning; Pap smear; Performances evaluation; Feature extraction; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; colposcopy; cytology; decision tree; deep learning; deep neural network; feature extraction; female; human; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; machine learning; Papanicolaou test; random forest; residual neural network; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; uterine cervix cancer","","","Akpudo, Ugochukwu Ejike, D-dcnn: A novel hybrid deep learning-based tool for vibration-based diagnostics, Energies, 14, 17, (2021); Basak, Hritam, Cervical Cytology Classification Using PCA and GWO Enhanced Deep Features Selection, SN Computer Science, 2, 5, (2021); Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, (1763); Bedell, Sarah L., Cervical Cancer Screening: Past, Present, and Future, Sexual Medicine Reviews, 8, 1, pp. 28-37, (2020); Bobdey, Saurabh C., Burden of cervical cancer and role of screening in India, Indian Journal of Medical and Paediatric Oncology, 37, 4, pp. 278-285, (2016); Dong, Na, Inception v3 based cervical cell classification combined with artificially extracted features, Applied Soft Computing, 93, (2020); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Ho, Tin Kam, Random decision forests, Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR, 1, pp. 278-282, (1995); Jenkins, David M., Histopathology and cytopathology of cervical cancer, Disease Markers, 23, 4, pp. 199-212, (2007); Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2017)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","21681171; 21681163","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145935176"

Therefore, early prediction of HD risks is crucial for prevention and treatment. Unfortunately, current clinical procedures for diagnosing HD are costly and often require an expert level of intervention. In response to this issue, researchers have recently developed various intelligent systems for the automated diagnosis of HD. Among the developed approaches, those based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have gained more popularity due to their promising prediction results. However, to the authors’ knowledge, no research has attempted to exploit ANNs for feature extraction. Hence, research into bridging this gap is worthwhile for more excellent predictions. Motivated by this fact, this research proposes a new approach for HD prediction, utilizing a pre-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and Logistic Regression (LR) for prediction.

Experimental results revealed that the proposed approach performs well on both the training and testing data, with accuracy rates of 91.79% and 93.33%, respectively.

Traditionally, a majority of the limited ground-truth data is used for training, while a handful of samples are left for testing. In that case, the number of test samples is inadequate to properly evaluate the robustness of the ML models under test (i.e., the system under test) for classification and regression. Furthermore, the output of these ML models may be inaccurate or even fail if the input data differ from the expected. This is the case for ML models used in the Electroslag Remelting (ESR) process in the refined steel industry to predict the pressure in a vacuum chamber. A vacuum pumping event that occurs once a workday generates a few hundred samples in a year of pumping for training and testing. In the absence of adequate training and test samples, this paper first presents a method to generate a fresh set of augmented samples based on vacuum pumping principles. Based on the generated augmented samples, three test scenarios and one test oracle are presented to assess the robustness of an ML model used for production on an industrial scale. Experiments are conducted with real industrial production data obtained from Uddeholms AB steel company. The evaluations indicate that Ensemble and Neural Network are the most robust when trained on augmented data using the proposed testing strategy. The evaluation also demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness in checking and improving ML algorithms' robustness in such situations. The work improves software testing's state-of-the-art robustness testing in similar settings. Finally, the paper presents an MLOps implementation of the proposed approach for real-time ML model prediction and action on the edge node and automated continuous delivery of ML software from the cloud. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Augmentation; Data Decomposition; Machine Learning; Mlops; Software Testing; Vacuum Pumping; Classification (of Information); Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Manufacture; Regression Analysis; Software Testing; Steelmaking; Testing; Data Augmentation; Data Decomposition; Industrial Production; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Mlops; Pumping Applications; Software Testings; Test Samples; Vacuum Pumping; Application Programs","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Manufacture; Regression analysis; Software testing; Steelmaking; Testing; Data augmentation; Data decomposition; Industrial production; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mlops; Pumping applications; Software testings; Test samples; Vacuum pumping; Application programs","","","Alam, Muhammad Iftekhar, Orchestration of Microservices for IoT Using Docker and Edge Computing, IEEE Communications Magazine, 56, 9, pp. 118-123, (2018); Arh, Boštjan, Electroslag remelting: A process overview, Materiali in Tehnologije, 50, 6, pp. 971-979, (2016); Bergstra, James, Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization, (2011); Cawley, Gavin C., Preventing over-fitting during model selection via bayesian regularisation of the hyper-parameters, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 8, pp. 841-861, (2007); International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research, (2011); Dmitrieva, Valentina V., Simulation modelling in vacuum engineering, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 798, 1, (2017); Ge, Dongdong, A note on the complexity of Lp minimization, Mathematical Programming, 129, 2, pp. 285-299, (2011); Theory Behind Overfitting Cross Validation Regularization Bagging and Boosting Tutorial, (2019); Giegerich, T., The KALPUREX-process - A new vacuum pumping process for exhaust gases in fusion power plants, Fusion Engineering and Design, 89, 7-8, pp. 1476-1481, (2014); Guo, Jianmei, Variability-aware performance prediction: A statistical learning approach, pp. 301-311, (2013)","Roychoudhury, A.; Cadar, C.; Kim, M.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGSOFT; National University of Singapore","30th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, ESEC/FSE 2022","","Singapore","184166","","9781450394130","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143079890"

Therefore, identifying noticeable placement errors is an important goal in the testing of AR apps. However, placement errors can only be perceived by human beings and may need to be confirmed by multiple users, making automatic testing very challenging. In this paper, we propose PredART, a novel approach to predict human ratings of virtual object placements that can be used as test oracles in automated AR testing. PredART is based on automatic screenshot sampling, crowd sourcing, and a hybrid neural network for image regression. The evaluation on a test set of 480 screenshots shows that our approach can achieve an accuracy of 85.0% and a mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error of 0.047, 0.008, and 0.091, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmented Reality; Placement Error; Virtual Objects; Automatic Testing; Errors; Mean Square Error; Virtual Reality; 'current; Human Being; Multiple User; New Applications; Object Placement; Placement Error; Screenshots; Test Oracles; Users' Experiences; Virtual Objects; Augmented Reality","Automatic testing; Errors; Mean square error; Virtual reality; 'current; Human being; Multiple user; New applications; Object placement; Placement error; Screenshots; Test oracles; Users' experiences; Virtual objects; Augmented reality","","","Unity, (2005); Apple Arkit, (2018); Microsoft Hololens, (2018); Oculus Rift, (2025); Xr Plug in Framework, (2019); Unity Mars, (2020); Google AR Core, (2021); Outlier Analysis, (2017); Amazon Mechanical Turk, (2005); Azuma, Ronald T., A survey of augmented reality, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 6, 4, pp. 355-385, (1997)","Aehnelt, M.; Kirste, T.","Association for Computing Machinery","Ford; Google; HUAWEI; IBM; Meta; Oakland University","37th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2022","","Rochester; MI; Oakland Center","186042","","9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146944277"

This technological advance relies heavily on software solutions of increasing complexity which results in novel challenges in the domain of software testing. Most prominently, while an ever higher number of test cases is required to meet quality demands, performing a large number of test cases frequently amounts to a significant increase in development time and costs. In order to overcome this issue, agile development methods such as continuous integration usually only execute a subset of important test cases to meet both time and testing demands. One way of selecting such a subset of important test cases is to assign priorities to all the available test cases and then greedily pick the ones with the highest priority until the available time budget is spent. For this, in a previous work, we presented a new machine learning approach based on a learning classifier system (LCS). In the present article, we summarize our earlier findings (which are spread over several publications) and provide insights about the most recent adaptations we made to the method. We also provide an extended experimental analysis that outlines more in detail how it compares to a state of the art artificial neural network. It can be observed that the performance of our LCS-based approach is often much higher than the one of the network. Since our work has already been deployed by a major company, we give an overview of the resulting product as well as several of its in-production quality attributes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Integration; Evolutionary Machine Learning; Software Testing; Xcsf Classifier System","","","","Anand, Saswat, An orchestrated survey of methodologies for automated software test case generation, Journal of Systems and Software, 86, 8, pp. 1978-2001, (2013); Arrieta, Aitor, Multi-objective black-box test case selection for cost-effectively testing simulation models, pp. 1411-1418, (2018); Butz, Martin V., An algorithmic description of XCS, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1996, pp. 253-272, (2001); Structured Programming, (1972); Revisiting Fundamentals of Experience Replay, (2020); Iso Iec 25010; Continuous Integration, (2006); Fraser, Gordon, Redundancy based test-suite reduction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4422 LNCS, pp. 291-305, (2007); Hsu, Hwayou, MINTS: A general framework and tool for supporting test-suite minimization, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 419-429, (2009); Huang, Rubing, A Survey on Adaptive Random Testing, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 47, 10, pp. 2052-2083, (2021)","","Springer","","","","","","26618907; 2662995X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134245413"

Molecular biology and clinical studies have shown that tumor invasion and micrometastasis are likely to appear in the early stages of tumor occurrence. At present, the existing methods have poor specificity, low sensitivity, and long detection time. It is difficult to detect the occurrence or metastasis of tumors in time, and it is difficult to evaluate the efficacy in an early stage. Therefore, the detection of CTCs and their types in the peripheral blood of patients is of great significance in the early detection of tumor cell recurrence and metastasis, evaluation of prognosis and efficacy, determination of tumor molecular characteristics, and selection of appropriate individualized treatments. At the same time, the later the clinical pathological stage, the worse the prognosis, which has been widely confirmed in many studies. This study mainly explores the application of convolutional neural networks in gastrointestinal tumors and tap detection. In order to facilitate the construction, training, verification and testing of the target detection network, uses the python development language for code writing, and conducts the model training in the Ubuntu system environment. The model part is the constructed target detection network. This article uses 4 network model. Training refers to the update calculation of loss function and network. Adam optimization update network parameters, cross-entropy cost function is used to calculate category loss, and SmoothL1 is used to calculate position loss of border regression. The main function of recording is to record the loss function value and verification set accuracy data during the network training process and various detection data during the network training. During the TAP test, 20−30μl (2 drops) of blood from the end of the finger or earlobe of the subject is routinely collected and pushed into 2 large and uniform blood slices, placed in a constant temperature and humidity working environment, and placed flat. After the reaction is complete and the stain is dry, the results can be observed by microscope inspection.

The logistics system focuses on realizing the space and time efficiency of material and understanding the links of logistics to achieve the optimum economic effect. Therefore, in this study, 150 data were collected from 20 hospitals in Malaysia to adopt the automated logistic system under simulation of the computer to decrease the costs of hospitals and increase the serviceability (output). Since obtaining this information for the automated logistic systems is not easy and has a high cost in a traditional way, this study was performed by the integration of artificial neural network (ANN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as the ANN-PSO. The input data that were obtained from the processing of automated logistic system in hospitals verified by using a hybrid of ANN-PSO. Later, the results were measured with five regression indicators of determination coefficient (R2), root mean square (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) and Willmott’s index (WI). Considering the results of RMSE, RSQR and r in both testing and training phases, the good performance of ANN-PSO in determining the effectiveness of applying automated logistic system using computer simulation method in hospital management, in terms of raising its serviceability and reducing the costs was proved. As a result, it was shown that ANN-PSO can successfully determine the effectiveness of using an automated logistic system under computer simulation method in hospital management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Automatic Logistic Systems; Reliability And Efficiency; Simulation; Swarm Optimization; Automation; Correlation Methods; Efficiency; Hospitals; Neural Networks; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso); Determination Coefficients; Enterprise Logistics; Framework Designs; Hospital Management; Logistic Systems; Logistics System; Model Efficiency; Pearson Correlation Coefficients; Costs","Automation; Correlation methods; Efficiency; Hospitals; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Determination coefficients; Enterprise logistics; Framework designs; Hospital management; Logistic systems; Logistics system; Model efficiency; Pearson correlation coefficients; Costs","","","Lyu, Zhihan, Interaction of Edge-Cloud Computing Based on SDN and NFV for Next Generation IoT, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 7, pp. 5706-5712, (2020); Guan, Zhengyu, MFQE 2.0: A New Approach for Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement on Compressed Video, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43, 3, pp. 949-963, (2021); Ni, Tianming, A Cost-Effective TSV Repair Architecture for Clustered Faults in 3-D IC, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 40, 9, pp. 1952-1956, (2021); Hu, Xuefeng, An Integrated Step-Up Inverter Without Transformer and Leakage Current for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 34, 10, pp. 9814-9827, (2019); Kordestani, Hadi, Beam damage detection under a moving load using random decrement technique and savitzky–golay filter, Sensors, 20, 1, (2020); Zhang, Chunwei, Swing vibration control of suspended structures using the Active Rotary Inertia Driver system: Theoretical modeling and experimental verification, Structural Control and Health Monitoring, 27, 6, (2020); Mou, Ben, Flexural behavior of beam to column joints with or without an overlying concrete slab, Engineering Structures, 199, (2019); Mou, Ben, Shear Behavior of Panel Zones in Steel Beam-to-Column Connections with Unequal Depth of Outer Annular Stiffener, Journal of Structural Engineering, 145, 2, (2019); Qi, Chongchong, Cemented paste backfill for mineral tailings management: Review and future perspectives, Minerals Engineering, 144, (2019); Qi, Chongchong, Structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of calcium aluminate cements: Insight from first-principles theory, Construction and Building Materials, 264, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14355663; 01770667","","ENGCE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104762377"

However, it also introduces new challenges for quality assurance activities, including regression testing, which is the focus of this work. Though various approaches for test case prioritization have shown to be very promising in the context of regression testing, specific techniques must be designed to deal with the dynamic nature and timing constraints of CI. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential in various challenging scenarios that require continuous adaptation, such as game playing, real-time ads bidding, and recommender systems. Inspired by this line of work and building on initial efforts in supporting test case prioritization with RL techniques, we perform here a comprehensive investigation of RL-based test case prioritization in a CI context. To this end, taking test case prioritization as a ranking problem, we model the sequential interactions between the CI environment and a test case prioritization agent as an RL problem, using three alternative ranking models. We then rely on carefully selected and tailored state-of-the-art RL techniques to automatically and continuously learn a test case prioritization strategy, whose objective is to be as close as possible to the optimal one. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the best RL solutions provide a significant accuracy improvement over previous RL-based work, with prioritization strategies getting close to being optimal, thus paving the way for using RL to prioritize test cases in a CI context. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ci; Continuous Integration; Reinforcement Learning; Test Prioritization; Continuous Time Systems; Learning To Rank; Quality Assurance; Real Time Systems; Software Testing; Testing; Accuracy Improvement; Alternative Ranking; Continuous Integrations; Experimental Analysis; Integration Problems; Regression Testing; Sequential Interactions; Test Case Prioritization; Reinforcement Learning","Continuous time systems; Learning to rank; Quality assurance; Real time systems; Software testing; Testing; Accuracy Improvement; Alternative ranking; Continuous integrations; Experimental analysis; Integration problems; Regression testing; Sequential interactions; Test case prioritization; Reinforcement learning","","","Continuous Integration Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk, (2007); Continuous Delivery Reliable Software Releases Through Build Test and Deployment Automation, (2010); Rothermel, Gregg, Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 27, 10, pp. 929-948, (2001); Kim, Jung-min, A history-based test prioritization technique for regression testing in resource constrained environments, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 119-129, (2002); Busjaeger, Benjamin, Learning for test prioritization: An industrial case study, 13-18-November-2016, pp. 975-980, (2016); Bertolino, Antonia, Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-learn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1-12, (2020); Zhang, Chongsheng, On Incremental Learning for Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Neural Processing Letters, 50, 1, pp. 957-987, (2019); Silver, David, A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and Go through self-play, Science, 362, 6419, pp. 1140-1144, (2018); Cai, Han, Real-time bidding by reinforcement learning in display advertising, pp. 661-670, (2017); Zhao, Xiangyu, Recommendations with negative feedback via pairwise deep reinforcement learning, pp. 1040-1048, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","00985589","","IESED","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103790131"

Rapid and accurate AMR diagnostic methods are thus very urgently needed. However, traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is time-consuming, low throughput and viable only for cultivable bacteria. Machine learning methods may pave the way for automated AMR prediction based on genomic data of the bacteria. However, comparing different machine learning methods for the prediction of AMR based on different encodings and whole-genome sequencing data without previously known knowledge remains to be done. Results: In this study, we evaluated logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. We could demonstrate that these models can effectively predict AMR with label encoding, one-hot encoding and frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR encoding) on whole-genome sequencing data. We trained these models on a large AMR dataset and evaluated them on an independent public dataset. Generally, RFs and CNNs perform better than LR and SVM with AUCs up to 0.96. Furthermore, we were able to identify mutations that are associated with AMR for each antibiotic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ciprofloxacin; Anti-bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin; Antiinfective Agent; Ciprofloxacin; Animal; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacterium; Genetics; Genomics; Human; Machine Learning; Animals; Anti-bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Ciprofloxacin; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning","antiinfective agent; ciprofloxacin; animal; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; genetics; genomics; human; machine learning; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Ciprofloxacin; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning","","ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1, 86393-32-0, 128074-72-6, 128074-76-0, 192934-52-4, 93107-08-5, 86483-48-9, 96186-80-0; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ciprofloxacin","Abdolmaleki, Zohreh, Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of antibiotic resistance in the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from hospital cockroaches, Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control, 8, 1, (2019); Almeida, Jonas S., Analysis of genomic sequences by Chaos Game Representation, Bioinformatics, 17, 5, pp. 429-437, (2001); Arango-Argoty, Gustavo Alonso, DeepARG: A deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data, Microbiome, 6, 1, (2018); Beceiro, Alejandro, Antimicrobial resistance and virulence: A successful or deleterious association in the bacterial world?, Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 26, 2, pp. 185-230, (2013); Boolchandani, Manish, Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance, Nature Reviews Genetics, 20, 6, pp. 356-370, (2019); Brimacombe, Michael B., Antibiotic resistance and single-nucleotide polymorphism cluster grouping type in a multinational sample of resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 51, 11, pp. 4157-4159, (2007); Chen, Shifu, Fastp: An ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor, Bioinformatics, 34, 17, pp. i884-i890, (2018); Cingolani, Pablo E., A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3, Fly, 6, 2, pp. 80-92, (2012); Daněček, Petr, The variant call format and VCFtools, Bioinformatics, 27, 15, pp. 2156-2158, (2011); Daněček, Petr, Twelve years of SAMtools and BCFtools, GigaScience, 10, 2, (2021)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","13674811; 13674803","9783540241669","BOINF","34613360","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126315987"

The well-being of companion animals such as dogs and cats has become a large challenge. An increasing number of pet owners, their emotional attachment with their pets, and the 21st-century's lifestyle importantly need the safety and welfare of pets by harnessing a smart technological approach. This paper analyzes and compares different machine learning algorithms for data-driven intelligent feeding system for pet care application. Different parameters such as body weight growth, body temperature, heart rate, eating habits, activity, sleep, and urine pH have been considered with other correlated sub-variables in creating virtual datasets. The supervised machine learning models: linear regression, gaussian process regression, narrow neural network, linear support vector machine, and fine tree are evaluated and discussed for estimating feed quantity. The machine learning model was verified by training, validation, and testing datasets. The developed model will be an innovative breakthrough for pet care applications. Feed estimation can be automated using the pet's health parameters, this will help the pet to prevent obesity and related disorders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent Feeding; Pet Care; Pet Feeding; Smart Feeding; Digital Devices; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Materials Handling Equipment; Support Vector Machines; Wearable Technology; Daily Lives; Data Driven; Digital Information Processing; Feeding System; Information Processing Technology; Intelligent Feeding; Machine Learning Models; Pet Care; Pet Feeding; Smart Feeding; Feeding","Digital devices; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Materials handling equipment; Support vector machines; Wearable technology; Daily lives; Data driven; Digital information processing; Feeding system; Information processing technology; Intelligent feeding; Machine learning models; Pet care; Pet feeding; Smart feeding; Feeding","","","Pet Ownership, (2016); Autonomous Driverless Car Market Growth Trends Covid 19 Impact and Forecast 2022 2027, (2022); Pet Industry Market Size Trends Ownership Statistics, (2021); An Analysis of Pet Related Industries and their Course of Development, (2016); Muñoz-Prieto, Alberto, European dog owner perceptions of obesity and factors associated with human and canine obesity, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Kopelman, Peter G., Obesity as a medical problem, Nature, 404, 6778, pp. 635-643, (2000); Pet Obesity Ten Years on 2009 2019, (2019); U S Pet Obesity Rates Plateau and Nutritional Confusion Grows, (2019); Junior, Roberto Lima, IoT applications for monitoring companion animals: A systematic literature review, pp. 239-246, (2020); Kim, Seungcheon, Smart pet care system using internet of things, International Journal of Smart Home, 10, 3, pp. 211-218, (2016)","","IEEE Computer Society","","22nd International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems, ICCAS 2022","","Busan","185972","15987833","9788993215182; 9788993215243; 9788993215274; 9788993215052; 9788993215151; 9788993215069; 9788993215205; 9788993215137; 9788993215212; 9788993215120","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146556702"

This paper provides a deep learning-based decryptor for investigating the permutation primitives used in multimedia block cipher encryption algorithms.We aim to investigate how deep learning can be used to improve on previous classical works by employing ciphertext pair aspects to maximize information extraction with low-data constraints by using convolution neural network features to discover the correlation among permutable atoms to extract the plaintext from the ciphered text without any P-box expertise. The evaluation of testing methods has been conceptualized as a regression task in which neural networks are supervised using a variety of parameters such as variations between input and output, number of iterations, and P-box generation patterns. On the other hand, the transfer learning skills demonstrated in this study indicate that discovering suitable testing models from the ground is also achievable using our model with optimum prior cryptographic expertise, where we contribute the results of deep learning in the field of deep learning based differential cryptanalysis development.Various experiments were performed on discrete and continuous chaotic and non-chaotic permutation patterns, and the best-performing model had an MSE of 1.8217{e}^{-04} and an R^{2} of 1, demonstrating the practicality of the suggested technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attack; Block Cipher; Ciphertext; Convolution; Cryptanalysis; Deconvolution; Deep Learning; P-box; Plaintext; Convolution; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Differential Equations; Learning Algorithms; Lyapunov Methods; Neural Networks; Personnel Training; Security Of Data; Testing; Attack; Block Ciphers; Cipher; Ciphertexts; Convolutional Neural Network; Cryptanalyse; Deconvolutions; Features Extraction; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; P-box; Plaintext; Training Data; Cryptography","Convolution; Data mining; Deep learning; Differential equations; Learning algorithms; Lyapunov methods; Neural networks; Personnel training; Security of data; Testing; Attack; Block ciphers; Cipher; Ciphertexts; Convolutional neural network; Cryptanalyse; Deconvolutions; Features extraction; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; P-box; Plaintext; Training data; Cryptography","","","Fadl, Mohamed Fadl Idris, A Deep Learning Approach for Active S-Box Prediction of Lightweight Generalized Feistel Block Ciphers, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 104205-104216, (2021); School Comput Sci IT Cryptol Eprint Arch Cork Irland Tech Rep 1479, (2021); International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology, (1991); Gohr, Aron, Improving Attacks on Round-Reduced Speck32/64 Using Deep Learning, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11693 LNCS, pp. 150-179, (2019); Hou, Botao, Linear attack on round-reduced des using deep learning, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12309 LNCS, pp. 131-145, (2020); Inst Artif Intell Blockchain Guangzhou China Tech Rep 4735, (2020); Liu, Guozhen, Preimage Attacks Against Lightweight Scheme Xoodyak Based on Deep Learning, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1364 AISC, pp. 637-648, (2021); Benamira, Adrien, A Deeper Look at Machine Learning-Based Cryptanalysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12696 LNCS, pp. 805-835, (2021); Jain, Aayush, Analysis of lightweight block cipher FeW on the basis of neural network, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 741, pp. 1041-1047, (2019); Focardi, Riccardo, Neural cryptanalysis of classical ciphers?, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2243, pp. 104-115, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137880184"

During the training process of DL, a large amount of GPU computing resources is required, but it is difficult for developers to accurately calculate the GPU resources that the model may consume before running, which brings great inconvenience to the development of DL systems. Especially in today's cloud-based model training. Therefore, it is very important to estimate the GPU memory resources that the DL model may use in a certain computing framework. Existing work has focused on static analysis methods to assess GPU memory consumption, highly coupled with the framework, and lack of research on low-coupled GPU memory consumption of the framework. In this article, we propose TBEM, which is a test-based method for estimating the memory usage of the DL model. First, TBEM generates enough DL models using an orthogonal array testing strategy and a classical neural network design pattern. Then, TBEM generates DL model tested in a real environment to obtain the real-time GPU memory usage values corresponding to the model. After obtaining the data of different models and corresponding GPU usage values, the data is analyzed by regression. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Testing; Bug Detection; Deep Learning; Program Static Analysis; Application Programs; Computer Graphics; Deep Learning; Graphics Processing Unit; Neural Networks; Program Processors; Software Testing; Automated Testing; Bug Detection; Computational Modelling; Graphic Processing Unit; Graphics Processing; Neural-networks; Processing Units; Program Static Analyse; Static Analysis","Application programs; Computer graphics; Deep learning; Graphics processing unit; Neural networks; Program processors; Software testing; Automated testing; Bug detection; Computational modelling; Graphic processing unit; Graphics processing; Neural-networks; Processing units; Program static analyse; Static analysis","","","Floridi, Luciano, GPT-3: Its Nature, Scope, Limits, and Consequences, Minds and Machines, 30, 4, pp. 681-694, (2020); Zhang, Ru, An empirical study on program failures of deep learning jobs, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1159-1170, (2020); Humbatova, Nargiz, Taxonomy of real faults in deep learning systems, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1110-1121, (2020); Gao, Yanjie, Estimating GPU memory consumption of deep learning models, pp. 1342-1352, (2020); Guo, Qianyu, Audee: Automated Testing for Deep Learning Frameworks, pp. 486-498, (2020); Pham, Hung Viet, CRADLE: Cross-Backend Validation to Detect and Localize Bugs in Deep Learning Libraries, Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering, 2019-May, pp. 1027-1038, (2019); Recent Adv Appl Theor Math, (2013); Wu, Hao, Application of orthogonal experimental design for the automatic software testing, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 347-350, pp. 812-818, (2013); Computer Curve Fitting of Polynomials; Liu, Shaoying, SOFL: A formal engineering methodology for industrial applications, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 24, 1, pp. 24-45, (1998)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128333356"

The deep learning model uses the CBC test results to detect the virus with an accuracy of 89.26%, which achieve higher accuracy than the widely used RT-PCR test. The model has achieved accuracy with only a thousand rows, which assures that the model can achieve better results with more data. The objective of the paper is to provide an automated and accurate method to detect COVID-19 using machine learning to apply it in large-scale testing, to help in containing the virus and prevent the spread of the virus. The scope of the paper is on the detection methodology using the blood platelets values extracted from the complete blood cycle (CBC) testing and discussing the future possibilities of improving the automated prevention method. The paper uses a dataset provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil, which has over 50 features of different tests as Influenza A, Influenza B, Uria, etc.…, many of these features had missing values or wasn’t relevant to the existence of the virus in the body; therefore, the feature selection led to filtering the 17 blood features. The K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Imputation imputed the missing values in the 17 filtered values. The analysis & visualization of the blood features concluded that the complete blood cycle test values highly correlated with each other, and there is a change occurs due to the presence of the virus is clear, especially to Eosinophils and Leukocytes, at which they represent the white blood cells forming the immune system that reacts against any virus or bacteria attracting the human body. The paper has applied five different machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, K neighbours and decision tree. Meanwhile, in the second approach, used an artificial neural network with intensive use of network optimization and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the highest accuracy possible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blood Platelets; Covid-19; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Network","","","","Xie, Xingzhi, Chest CT for Typical Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia: Relationship to Negative RT-PCR Testing, Radiology, 296, 2, pp. E41-E45, (2020); George-Gay, Beverly, Understanding the complete blood count with differential, Journal of Perianesthesia Nursing, 18, 2, pp. 96-117, (2003); undefined; Chawla, Nitesh Vinay, SMOTE: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002)","Auer, M.E.; Bhimavaram, K.R.; Yue, X.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","18th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation, REV 2021","","Virtual, Online","265719","23673389; 23673370","9789819652372; 9783031931055; 9789819662968; 9783031999963; 9783031950162; 9783031947698; 9783032004406; 9783031910074; 9783031926105; 9789819639410","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115830198"

Serverless applications follow this model, where the application is decomposed into a set of fine-grained Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) functions. However, the obscurities of the underlying system infrastructure and dependencies between FaaS functions within the application pose a challenge for estimating the performance of FaaS functions. To characterize the performance of a FaaS function that is relevant for the user, we define Function Capacity (FC) as the maximal number of concurrent invocations the function can serve in a time without violating the Service-Level Objective (SLO). The paper addresses the challenge of quantifying the FC individually for each FaaS function within a serverless application. This challenge is addressed by sandboxing a FaaS function and building its performance model. To this end, we develop FnCapacitor - an end-to-end automated Function Capacity estimation tool. We demonstrate the functioning of our tool on Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and AWS Lambda. FnCapacitor estimates the FCs on different deployment configurations (allocated memory & maximum function instances) by conducting time-framed load tests and building various models using statistical: linear, ridge, and polynomial regression, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods on the acquired performance data. Our evaluation of different FaaS functions shows relatively accurate predictions with an accuracy greater than 75% using DNN for both cloud providers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Function Capacity; Function-as-a-service; Serverless Computing; Computation Theory; Load Testing; Business Logic; Cloud Service Providers; Cloud-computing; Computing Paradigm; Function Capacity; Function-as-a-service; Performance; Resource Management; Serverless Computing; Service Functions; Deep Neural Networks","Computation theory; Load testing; Business logic; Cloud service providers; Cloud-computing; Computing paradigm; Function capacity; Function-as-a-service; Performance; Resource management; Serverless computing; Service functions; Deep neural networks","","","Aws Lambda; Azure Functions Hosting Options; Cloud Functions Overview; Regression Score; Akhtar, Nabeel, COSE: Configuring Serverless Functions using Statistical Learning, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2020-July, pp. 129-138, (2020); Carreira, Joao, Cirrus: A Serverless Framework for End-To-end ML Workflows, pp. 13-24, (2019); Castro, Paul, The rise of serverless computing, Communications of the ACM, 62, 12, pp. 44-54, (2019); Chadha, Mohak, Towards Federated Learning using FaaS Fabric, pp. 49-54, (2020); Architecture Specific Performance Optimization of Compute Intensive Faas Functions, (2021); Serverless Supercomputing High Performance Function as A Service for Science, (2019)","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGARCH; EEE Computer Society","14th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, UCC 2021","","Leicester","176957","","9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119575511"

When looking to sell a car, the seller decides the price of their car after monitoring the prices of similar cars in the advertisements. When someone is looking to buy a car, they watch advertisements for similar cars to get an idea of the price of the car they want to purchase. Despite the availability of blue books that provide an estimate of automotive pricing, real market prices vary depending on demand and supply. In this paper, we applied cutting-edge machine learning techniques to automate this process. The training data set is up-to-date and it was collected from an active commercial website. We created semi-automated rule-based scripts to clean and prepare the data for machine learning. Several machine learning algorithms were explored to generate an approximate value for the car pricing, including Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree. To determine the features that most affect the price, extensive data analysis and cleaning were undertaken. Our findings indicate that the testing accuracy is 90%. Finally, a mobile application was created that provides an estimated price of a given car's properties, guiding a user in determining the price of their car.

The virtual sensors allow data fusion from various vehicle sensors and provide a prediction for measurement that is hard or too expensive to measure in another way or in the case of demand on continuous detection. In this paper, virtual sensing is discussed for the case of vehicle suspension control, where information about the relative velocity of the unsprung mass for each vehicle corner is required. The corresponding goal can be identified as a regression task with multi‐input sequence input. The hypothesis is that the state‐of‐art method of Bidirectional Long–Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) can solve it. In this paper, a virtual sensor has been proposed and developed by training a neural network model. The simulations have been performed using an experimentally validated full vehicle model in IPG Carmaker. Simulations provided the reference data which were used for Neural Network (NN) training. The extensive dataset covering 26 scenarios has been used to obtain training, validation and testing data. The Bayesian Search was used to select the best neural network structure using root mean square error as a metric.

Phenotypes derived from these images, such as measurements of body composition from MRI, can reveal new links between genetics, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic conditions. In this work, six measurements of body composition and adipose tissues were automatically estimated by image-based, deep regression with ResNet50 neural networks from neck-to-knee body MRI. Despite the potential for high speed and accuracy, these networks produce no output segmentations that could indicate the reliability of individual measurements. The presented experiments therefore examine uncertainty quantification with mean-variance regression and ensembling to estimate individual measurement errors and thereby identify potential outliers, anomalies, and other failure cases automatically. In 10-fold cross-validation on data of about 8500 subjects, mean-variance regression and ensembling showed complementary benefits, reducing the mean absolute error across all predictions by 12%. Both improved the calibration of uncertainties and their ability to identify high prediction errors. With intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) above 0.97, all targets except the liver fat content yielded relative measurement errors below 5%. Testing on another 1000 subjects showed consistent performance, and the method was finally deployed for inference to 30,000 subjects with missing reference values. The results indicate that deep regression ensembles could ultimately provide automated, uncertainty-aware measurements of body composition for more than 120,000 UK Biobank neck-to-knee body MRI that are to be acquired within the coming years. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomarkers; Mri; Neural Networks; Uk Biobank; Biochemistry; Measurement Errors; Medical Imaging; Regression Analysis; Uncertainty Analysis; Biobanks; Body Composition; Body Composition Analysis; Cardiovascular Disease; Mean Variance; Measurements Of; Metabolic Conditions; Neural-networks; Uk Biobank; Uncertainty; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biological Marker; Abdominal Subcutaneous Fat; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Automation; Biobank; Body Composition; Cardiovascular Disease; Cohort Analysis; Comparative Study; Correlation Coefficient; Cross Validation; Female; Genetics; Human; Image Artifact; Intra-abdominal Fat; Kernel Method; Lean Tissue; Male; Measurement Accuracy; Measurement Error; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phenotype; Reliability; Resnet50 Neural Network; Segmentation Algorithm; Uncertainty; United Kingdom; Reproducibility; Biological Specimen Banks; Body Composition; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Reproducibility Of Results","Biochemistry; Measurement errors; Medical imaging; Regression analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Biobanks; Body composition; Body composition analysis; Cardiovascular disease; Mean variance; Measurements of; Metabolic conditions; Neural-networks; UK biobank; Uncertainty; Magnetic resonance imaging; biological marker; abdominal subcutaneous fat; adipose tissue; adult; aged; Article; artificial neural network; automation; biobank; body composition; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; comparative study; correlation coefficient; cross validation; female; genetics; human; image artifact; intra-abdominal fat; kernel method; lean tissue; male; measurement accuracy; measurement error; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; reliability; resnet50 neural network; segmentation algorithm; uncertainty; United Kingdom; reproducibility; Biological Specimen Banks; Body Composition; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Reproducibility of Results","","","undefined, (2020); Bagur, Alexandre Triay, Pancreas Segmentation-Derived Biomarkers: Volume and Shape Metrics in the UK Biobank Imaging Study, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1248 CCIS, pp. 131-142, (2020); Bai, Wenjia, Automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance image analysis with fully convolutional networks 08 Information and Computing Sciences 0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing, Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, 20, 1, (2018); Basty, Nicolas, Automated Measurement of Pancreatic Fat and Iron Concentration Using Multi-Echo and T1-Weighted MRI Data, Proceedings - International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, 2020-April, pp. 345-348, (2020); Borga, Magnus, MRI adipose tissue and muscle composition analysis-a review of automation techniques, British Journal of Radiology, 91, 1089, (2018); Borga, Magnus, Validation of a fast method for quantification of intra-abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue for large-scale human studies, NMR in Biomedicine, 28, 12, pp. 1747-1753, (2015); Cole, James H., Brain age predicts mortality, Molecular Psychiatry, 23, 5, pp. 1385-1392, (2018); Estrada, Santiago, FatSegNet: A fully automated deep learning pipeline for adipose tissue segmentation on abdominal dixon MRI, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 83, 4, pp. 1471-1483, (2020); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18790771; 08956111","","CMIGE","34624770","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116485243"

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, consecutive patients who underwent FDG PET imaging for oncologic indications were included (July–August 2018). The left ventricle (LV) on whole-body FDG PET images was manually segmented and classified as showing no myocardial uptake, diffuse uptake, or partial uptake. A total of 609 patients (mean age, 64 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 309 women) were included and split between training (60%, 365 patients), validation (20%, 122 patients), and testing (20%, 122 patients) datasets. Two sequential neural networks were developed to automatically segment the LV and classify the myocardial uptake pattern using segmentation and classification training data provided by human experts. Linear regression was performed to correlate findings from human experts and deep learning. Classification performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: There was moderate agreement of uptake pattern between experts and deep learning (as a fraction of correctly categorized images) with 78% (36 of 46) for no uptake, 71% (34 of 48) for diffuse uptake, and 71% (20 of 28) for partial uptake. There was no bias in LV volume for partial or diffuse uptake categories (P = .56); however, deep learning underestimated LV volumes in the no uptake category. There was good correlation for LV volume (R2 = 0.35, β = .71). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve for classifying no uptake and diffuse uptake was high (> 0.90) but lower for partial uptake (0.77). The feasibility of a myocardial uptake index (MUI) for quantifying the degree of myocardial activity patterns was shown, and there was excellent visual agreement between MUI and uptake patterns. Conclusion: Deep learning was able to segment and classify myocardial uptake patterns on FDG PET images. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Area Under The Curve; Article; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Feasibility Study; Female; Heart Left Ventricle Volume; Human; Linear Regression Analysis; Major Clinical Study; Middle Aged; Positron Emission Tomography; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Retrospective Study","adult; area under the curve; article; controlled study; deep learning; feasibility study; female; heart left ventricle volume; human; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; middle aged; positron emission tomography; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study","","","Randle, Pshilip J., THE GLUCOSE FATTY-ACID CYCLE ITS ROLE IN INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND THE METABOLIC DISTURBANCES OF DIABETES MELLITUS, The Lancet, 281, 7285, pp. 785-789, (1963); Neely, James R., Relationship between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and the energy balance of heart muscle., Annual Review of Physiology, 36, pp. 413-459, (1974); Lucignani, Giovanni, Presurgical identification of hibernating myocardium by combined use of technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile single photon emission tomography and fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography in patients with coronary artery disease, European Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 19, 10, pp. 874-881, (1992); Uehara, Toshihisa, Myocardial glucose metabolism in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment by F-18-FDG PET study, Annals of Nuclear Medicine, 12, 2, pp. 95-103, (1998); Minamimoto, Ryogo, Incidental focal FDG uptake in heart is a lighthouse for considering cardiac screening, Annals of Nuclear Medicine, 27, 6, pp. 572-580, (2013); Langah, Rumman, Effectiveness of prolonged fasting 18f-FDG PET-CT in the detection of cardiac sarcoidosis, Journal of Nuclear Cardiology, 16, 5, pp. 801-810, (2009); Okumura, Wataru, Usefulness of fasting18F-FDG PET in identification of cardiac sarcoidosis, Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 45, 12, pp. 1989-1998, (2004); Inglese, Eugenio, Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of regional myocardial uptake in patients without heart disease under fasting conditions on repeated whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT, Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 48, 10, pp. 1662-1669, (2007); Nose, Hayato, The physiological uptake pattern of 18F-FDG in the left ventricular myocardium of patients without heart disease, Journal of Medical Investigation, 61, 1-2, pp. 53-58, (2014); Höh, Carl K., Clinical use of FDG PET, Nuclear Medicine and Biology, 34, 7, pp. 737-742, (2007)","","Radiological Society of North America Inc.","","","","","","26386100","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113723953"

Several applications relevant to digital forensic investigations include the identification of victims, suspects and missing children, and the decrease of investigators’ exposure to psychologically impacting material. Nevertheless, due to the lack of accurately labelled age datasets, particularly for the underage age range, sufficient performance accuracy remains a major challenge in the field of age estimation. To address the problem, a novel regression-based model was created, Vec2UAge. FaceNet embeddings were extracted and used as feature vectors to train the model from the VisAGe and Selfie-FV datasets. A balanced, unbiased dataset was created for testing and validation. Data augmentation techniques were evaluated to further be used to expand the training dataset. The learning rate (lr) is one of the most important hyper-parameters for deep neural networks; a cyclic learning rate approach was used to find the optimal initial value for lr and the performance was evaluated. The distribution of model performance was presented per optimiser and one of the winning models with a Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) optimised training run reached a mean absolute error rate as low as 2.36 years. Additionally, the time of convergence using SWA was significantly faster than other optimisers evaluated, i.e., ADAGRAD, ADAM and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The evaluation model metric is presented in a form of a distribution rather than a single value, giving more insights into the effects of the random initialisations, optimisers and the learning rate on the outcome. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age Estimation; Child Sexual Exploitation/abuse Material (csem/csam); Deep Learning; Underage Facial Age; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks; Digital Forensics; Embeddings; Gradient Methods; Optimization; Statistical Tests; Stochastic Systems; Data Augmentation; Evaluation Modeling; Forensic Investigation; Mean Absolute Error; Missing Children; Model Performance; Regression-based Model; Stochastic Gradient Descent; Stochastic Models","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital forensics; Embeddings; Gradient methods; Optimization; Statistical tests; Stochastic systems; Data augmentation; Evaluation modeling; Forensic investigation; Mean absolute error; Missing children; Model performance; Regression-based model; Stochastic gradient descent; Stochastic models","","","Akiba, Takuya, Optuna: A Next-generation Hyperparameter Optimization Framework, pp. 2623-2631, (2019); Anda, Felix, Evaluating automated facial age estimation techniques for digital forensics, pp. 129-139, (2018); Anda, Felix, Improving borderline adulthood facial age estimation through ensemble learning, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2019); Anda, Felix, DeepUAge: Improving Underage Age Estimation Accuracy to Aid CSEM Investigation, Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, 32, (2020); Anda, Felix, Assessing the Influencing Factors on the Accuracy of Underage Facial Age Estimation, (2020); Antipov, Grigory, Apparent Age Estimation from Face Images Combining General and Children-Specialized Deep Learning Models, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 801-809, (2016); Bengio, Yoshua, Curriculum learning, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 382, (2009); Bloice, Marcus D., Biomedical image augmentation using Augmentor, Bioinformatics, 35, 21, pp. 4522-4524, (2019); Bollé, Timothy, The role of evaluations in reaching decisions using automated systems supporting forensic analysis, Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, 34, (2020); Bottou, Léon, Large-scale machine learning with stochastic gradient descent, pp. 177-186, (2010)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","26662825; 26662817","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103669298"

The correctness and computational complexity are the two required keys for a pain assessment application. Inspired by the fact that facial expression of pain can be described by the pain-related Facial Action Unit (AU) combinations, we propose a novel three stages training for pain intensity estimation approach. Based on the Inception Resnet architecture, we firstly learn to predict AUs from the combination of DISFA and UNBC McMaster databases using Heatmap regression. Secondly, we learn to predict pain level as linear regression. Lastly, we use a LSTM model to exploit the temporal relation between video frames. With this approach, we take advantage of two databases for regularization to prevent overfitting, while still maintaining the efficiency in term of complexity of the Inception Resnet architecture. Experiments on the UNBC McMaster database show that our approach yields a promising result compared to the state-of-the-art in automatic pain intensity estimation.

In addition, we explore different strategies and configurations for training these agents, and describe a simple procedure for detecting significant modifications in selected gameplay metrics of a game level after introducing design changes.

The proposed method also includes a signal-to-image technique, which is continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) that decomposes the AE signals over time-frequency scales and extracts the crack/fracture information in both the time and frequency domains. First, AE signals for two types of cracks (minor and severe), along with the normal condition (no crack), are collected from the experimental test bed. Second, the previously mentioned CWT based signal-to-image technique is applied to generate two-dimensional time-frequency images that are then converted to gray scale images for faster computation. These images are supplied to the SqueezeNet for classification of the concrete crack types. We extensively modified the fire module of the SqueezeNet (SQN-MF) by introducing depth-wise convolutional kernels and channel shuffling operations. Not only does the proposed method utilize deep learning-based techniques for crack classification of concrete beams for the first time, but also the CWT-based imaging technique has not yet been explored in this field either. Additionally, this method does not follow the typical AE burst feature (features like AE counts, peak-amplitude, rise time, decay time, etc.) based methods, and as a result, we no longer require extensive human intervention and expertise to get deep understanding of the crack types. SQN-MF achieves AlexNet-level accuracy with fifty times fewer parameters and has an implementable memory size for the field programmable gate array boards. Overall, the method achieves 100% accuracy. It is 20.8% higher than the typical feature extraction and traditional machine learning based methods. We observed a 4% accuracy increase for the proposed SQN-MF compared to the typical SqueezeNet with bypass connections. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concrete Crack Characterization; Continuous Wavelet Transformation; Convolutional Neural Network; Squeezenet; Acoustic Emission Testing; Concrete Beams And Girders; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Field Programmable Gate Arrays (fpga); Imaging Techniques; Learning Systems; Reinforced Concrete; Wavelet Transforms; Acoustic Emission Signal; Continuous Wavelet Transformation; Crack Characterization; Experimental Testbed; Learning-based Approach; Reinforced Concrete Beams; Time And Frequency Domains; Time-frequency Images; Deep Learning","Acoustic emission testing; Concrete beams and girders; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Imaging techniques; Learning systems; Reinforced concrete; Wavelet transforms; Acoustic emission signal; Continuous wavelet transformation; Crack characterization; Experimental testbed; Learning-based approach; Reinforced concrete beams; Time and frequency domains; Time-frequency images; Deep learning","","","Das, Avik Kumar, Machine learning based crack mode classification from unlabeled acoustic emission waveform features, Cement and Concrete Research, 121, pp. 42-57, (2019); Yu, Xiaoyang, Passive monitoring of nonlinear relaxation of cracked polymer concrete samples using acoustic emission, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 146, 4, pp. EL323-EL328, (2019); Aggelis, Dimitrios G., Acoustic emission characterization of damage sources of lightweight hybrid concrete beams, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 210, pp. 181-188, (2019); Aggelis, Dimitrios G., Classification of cracking mode in concrete by acoustic emission parameters, Mechanics Research Communications, 38, 3, pp. 153-157, (2011); Banjara, Nawal Kishor, Investigations on acoustic emission parameters during damage progression in shear deficient and GFRP strengthened reinforced concrete components, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 137, pp. 501-514, (2019); Tsangouri, Eleni, Structural health assessment of prefabricated concrete elements using Acoustic Emission: Towards an optimized damage sensing tool, Construction and Building Materials, 206, pp. 261-269, (2019); Yue, Jianguang, Uniaxial concrete tension damage evolution using acoustic emission monitoring, Construction and Building Materials, 232, (2020); Chen, Chen, Experimental investigation of concrete fracture behavior with different loading rates based on acoustic emission, Construction and Building Materials, 237, (2020); Hou, Tsung-Chin, Electrical impedance tomographic methods for sensing strain fields and crack damage in cementitious structures, Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 20, 11, pp. 1363-1379, (2009); Aldahdooh, M.

Image and video colorization can be applied to historical images, natural images, astronomical photography. This paper proposes a fully automated image colorization using a deep learning algorithm. First, the image dataset was selected for training and testing purposes. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed with several layers of convolutional and max pooling. Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression was used at the final stage. The proposed algorithm was implemented using Python with Keras and Tensorflow libraries in Google Colab.

Fungal blast is one of the significant plant diseases found in rice crops, leading to reduction of agricultural products and hindrance in the country's economic development. Plant disease detection is an initial step towards improving the yield and quality of agricultural products. Manual Analyzation of plant health is tiresome, time taking and costly. Machine learning offers an alternate inspection method providing benefits of automated inspection, ease of availability, and cost reduction. The visual patterns on the rice plants are processed using the machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, random forest, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), principal component analysis (PCA), and based on classification results plants are recognized as healthy or unhealthy. For this process, a dataset containing 1000 images of rice seed crop is collected from different fields of Kashmore, and whole analysis of image acquisition, pre-processing, and feature extraction is done on the rice seed only. The dataset is annotated with healthy and unhealthy samples with the help of a plant disease expert. The algorithms used for processing data are evaluated in terms of F1-score and testing accuracy. This paper contains results from traditional classifiers, and alongside these classifiers, transfer learning has been used to compare the results. Finally, a comparative analysis is done between the results of traditional classifiers and deep learning networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Classifier; Decision Tree; Deep Learning; F1-score; Feature Extraction; Fungal Blast; Image Acquisition; Linear Discriminant Analysis (lda); Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Naïve Bayes; Pre-processing; Principal Component Analysis (pca); Random Forest; Support Vector Machine (svm); Convolutional Neural Networks; Cost Reduction; Crops; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Discriminant Analysis; Extraction; Fungi; Image Acquisition; Image Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Random Forests; Support Vector Machines; Convolutional Classifier; F1 Scores; Features Extraction; Fungal Blast; Linear Discriminant Analyse; Linear Discriminant Analyze; Logistics Regressions; Naive Bayes; Pre-processing; Principal Component Analyse; Principal-component Analysis; Support Vector Machine; Support Vectors Machine; Feature Extraction","Convolutional neural networks; Cost reduction; Crops; Decision trees; Deep learning; Discriminant analysis; Extraction; Fungi; Image acquisition; Image analysis; Principal component analysis; Random forests; Support vector machines; Convolutional classifier; F1 scores; Features extraction; Fungal blast; Linear discriminant analyse; Linear discriminant analyze; Logistics regressions; Naive bayes; Pre-processing; Principal component analyse; Principal-component analysis; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Feature extraction","","","Khirade, Sachin D., Plant disease detection using image processing, pp. 768-771, (2015); Panchal, Poojan, Plant Diseases Detection and Classification using Machine Learning Models, (2019); Korkut, Umut Baris, Detection of plant diseases by machine learning, pp. 1-4, (2018); Plant Disease Detection in Image Processing Using Matlab, (2017); Kulkarni, Omkar S., Crop Disease Detection Using Deep Learning, (2018); Sherly Puspha Annabel, L., Machine learning for plant leaf disease detection and classification - A review, pp. 538-542, (2019); Ahmed, Kawcher, Rice leaf disease detection using machine learning techniques, (2019); Rice Leaf Diseases Data Set; Kurale, Neha G., Classification of Leaf Disease Using Texture Feature and Neural Network Classifier, pp. 1-6, (2018); Anjna, Hybrid System for Detection and Classification of Plant Disease Using Qualitative Texture Features Analysis, Procedia Computer Science, 167, pp. 1056-1065, (2020)","","Science and Information Organization","","","","","","21565570; 2158107X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102059575"

However, CFD suffers from a relatively long computational time that usually varies from dozens of minutes to hours. Machine learning is a popular tool that has been applied to many fields, and it can predict outcomes fast and even instantaneously in most applications. This study aims to use machine learning as an alternative to CFD for generating hemodynamic parameters in real-time diagnosis during medical examinations. To perform the feasibility study, we used CFD to model the blood flow in 2000 idealized coronary arteries, and the calculated WSS values in these models were used as the dataset for training and testing. The preparation of the dataset was automated by scripts programmed in Python, and OpenFOAM was used as the CFD solver. We have explored multivariate linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural network architectures to generate WSS values from coronary artery geometry directly without CFD. These architectures were implemented in TensorFlow 2.0. Our results showed that these algorithms were able to generate results in less than 1 s, proving its capability in real-time applications, in terms of computational time. Based on the accuracy, convolutional neural network outperformed the other architectures with a normalized mean absolute error of 2.5%. Although this study is based on idealized models, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to predict WSS in a stenosed coronary artery using machine learning approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Fluid Dynamics; Coronary Artery; Neural Network; Real-time Prediction; Wall Shear Stress; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Diagnosis; Heart; Machine Learning; Medical Imaging; Network Architecture; Shear Stress; Statistical Tests; Hemodynamic Parameters; Machine Learning Approaches; Multi Layer Perceptron; Multivariate Linear Regressions; Real-time Application; Real-time Diagnosis; Stenosed Coronary Arteries; Training And Testing; Multilayer Neural Networks; Article; Blood Flow; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Convolutional Neural Network; Coronary Artery; Feasibility Study; Geometry; Human; Linear Regression Analysis; Medical Examination; Multilayer Perceptron; Prediction; Shear Stress","Computational fluid dynamics; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Diagnosis; Heart; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Network architecture; Shear stress; Statistical tests; Hemodynamic parameters; Machine learning approaches; Multi layer perceptron; Multivariate linear regressions; Real-time application; Real-time diagnosis; Stenosed coronary arteries; Training and testing; Multilayer neural networks; article; blood flow; computational fluid dynamics; convolutional neural network; coronary artery; feasibility study; geometry; human; linear regression analysis; medical examination; multilayer perceptron; prediction; shear stress","","","Lee, Sang-joon, Association of early atherosclerosis with vascular wall shear stress in hypercholesterolemic zebrafish, PLOS ONE, 10, 11, (2015); Gijsen, Frank J.H., Expert recommendations on the assessment of wall shear stress in human coronary arteries: Existing methodologies, technical considerations, and clinical applications, European Heart Journal, 40, 41, pp. 3421-3433, (2019); Zhong, Liang, Application of patient-specific computational fluid dynamics in coronary and intra-cardiac flow simulations: Challenges and opportunities, Frontiers in Physiology, 9, JUN, (2018); Su, Boyang, Numerical investigation of blood flow in three-dimensional porcine left anterior descending artery with various stenoses, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 47, 1, pp. 130-138, (2014); Taylor, Charles Anthony, Computational fluid dynamics applied to cardiac computed tomography for noninvasive quantification of fractional flow reserve: Scientific basis, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 61, 22, pp. 2233-2241, (2013); Brunton, Steven L., Machine Learning for Fluid Mechanics, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 52, pp. 477-508, (2020); Rumelhart, David E., Learning representations by back-propagating errors, Nature, 323, 6088, pp. 533-536, (1986); Lecun, Yann Le, Deep learning, Nature, 521, 7553, pp. 436-444, (2015); Liang, Liang, A deep learning approach to estimate stress distribution: a fast and accurate surrogate of finite-element analysis, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 15, 138, (2018); Madani, Ali, Bridging Finite Element and Machine Learning Modeling: Stress Prediction of Arterial Walls in Atherosclerosis, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 141, 8, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18790534; 00104825","","CBMDA","33039809","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092058026"

Automated Pap smear cell recognition and classification in early stage of cell development is crucial for effective disease diagnosis and immediate treatment. Thus, in this article, we proposed a novel internet of health things (IoHT)-driven deep learning framework for detection and classification of cervical cancer in Pap smear images using concept of transfer learning. Following transfer learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) was combined with different conventional machine learning techniques like K nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest and support vector machines. In the proposed framework, feature extraction from cervical images is performed using pre-trained CNN models like InceptionV3, VGG19, SqueezeNet and ResNet50, which are fed into dense and flattened layer for normal and abnormal cervical cells classification. The performance of the proposed IoHT frameworks is evaluated using standard Pap smear Herlev dataset. The proposed approach was validated by analyzing precision, recall, F1-score, training–testing time and support parameters. The obtained results concluded that CNN pre-trained model ResNet50 achieved the higher classification rate of 97.89% with the involvement of random forest classifier for effective and reliable disease detection and classification. The minimum training time and testing time required to train model were 0.032 s and 0.006 s, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Ioht; Pre-trained; Regression; Transfer; Cells; Classification (of Information); Computer Aided Diagnosis; Cytology; Decision Trees; Developing Countries; Diseases; Electronic Document Exchange; Nearest Neighbor Search; Neural Networks; Support Vector Machines; Conventional Machines; Convolutional Neural Network; Ioht; Logistic Regressions; Pre-trained; Random Forest Classifier; Regression; Transfer; Deep Learning","Cells; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Cytology; Decision trees; Developing countries; Diseases; Electronic document exchange; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Conventional machines; Convolutional neural network; IoHT; Logistic regressions; Pre-trained; Random forest classifier; Regression; Transfer; Deep learning","","","Special section: Advances in artificial intelligence in biomedical image analysis, Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine, 41, 4, (2018); J Med Imaging Health Inform, (2019); Wong, Kelvin K.L., Multi-objective optimization and data analysis in informationization, Computing, 101, 6, pp. 495-498, (2019); Casadei, Roberto, A development approach for collective opportunistic Edge-of-Things services, Information Sciences, 498, pp. 154-169, (2019); Casadei, Roberto, Modelling and simulation of Opportunistic IoT Services with Aggregate Computing, Future Generation Computer Systems, 91, pp. 252-262, (2019); Hu, Zilong, Deep learning for image-based cancer detection and diagnosis − A survey, Pattern Recognition, 83, pp. 134-149, (2018); Khan, Sana Ullah, A novel deep learning based framework for the detection and classification of breast cancer using transfer learning, Pattern Recognition Letters, 125, pp. 1-6, (2019); Rodrigues, Murillo Barata, Health of Things Algorithms for Malignancy Level Classification of Lung Nodules, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 18592-18601, (2018); Masoumi, Hassan, Automatic liver segmentation in MRI images using an iterative watershed algorithm and artificial neural network, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 7, 5, pp. 429-437, (2012); Prediction in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy Brachytherapy, (2017)","","Springer","","","","","","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078587569"

However, only limited blooms events were recorded due to active dust storms limiting the observations. This work focuses on predicting the potential bloom events in the central region of the Red Sea, indicated by the chlorophyll-a values, through the machine learning models built from the simulated and observed oceanographical parameters. Four subregions showing active eddy activities are selected to generate modeling datasets in the Case-1 waters (water depth > 300 meters) for each region. Automated model selection and tuning are performed among different candidate supervised models including linear regression, trees models, ensemble models and deep neural networks (101 in total). The ensemble models (random decision forest and bootstrap decision forest) outperform others in showing effective performance in estimating chlorophyll-a values with (\mathrm{R}^{2} > 0.82) of the training and (\mathrm{R}^{2} > 0.73) of the testing processes, respectively.

Because such an oracle can be imperfect, the generated patches, although validated by the oracle, may actually be incorrect. While the state of the art explore research directions that require dynamic information or that rely on manually-crafted heuristics, we study the benefit of learning code representations in order to learn deep features that may encode the properties of patch correctness. Our empirical work mainly investigates different representation learning approaches for code changes to derive embeddings that are amenable to similarity computations. We report on findings based on embeddings produced by pre-trained and re-trained neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of embeddings to empower learning algorithms in reasoning about patch correctness: a machine learning predictor with BERT transformer-based embeddings associated with logistic regression yielded an AUC value of about 0.8 in the prediction of patch correctness on a deduplicated dataset of 1000 labeled patches. Our investigations show that learned representations can lead to reasonable performance when comparing against the state-of-the-art, PATCH-SIM, which relies on dynamic information. These representations may further be complementary to features that were carefully (manually) engineered in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed Representation Learning; Embeddings; Machine Learning; Patch Correctness; Program Repair; Automatic Test Pattern Generation; Automation; Codes (symbols); Embeddings; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Software Testing; Turing Machines; Code Changes; Code Representation; Dynamic Information; Learning Approach; On Dynamics; Similarity Computation; State Of The Art; Trained Neural Networks; Learning Algorithms","Automatic test pattern generation; Automation; Codes (symbols); Embeddings; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Software testing; Turing machines; Code changes; Code representation; Dynamic information; Learning approach; ON dynamics; Similarity computation; State of the art; Trained neural networks; Learning algorithms","","","Allamanis, Miltiadis, Learning NATURAL coding conventions, 16-21-November-2014, pp. 281-293, (2014); Allamanis, Miltiadis, A survey of machine learning for big code and naturalness, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 4, (2019); Alon, Uri, Code2vec: Learning distributed representations of code, Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, 3, POPL, (2019); Bader, Johannes, Getafix: Learning to fix bugs automatically, Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, 3, OOPSLA, (2019); Barr, Earl T., The plastic surgery hypothesis, 16-21-November-2014, pp. 306-317, (2014); Dagstuhl Reports, (2017); Compton, Rhys, Embedding Java Classes with code2vec: Improvements from Variable Obfuscation, pp. 243-253, (2020); Csuvik, Viktor, Utilizing Source Code Embeddings to Identify Correct Patches, pp. 18-25, (2020); Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Durieux, Thomas, Empirical review of Java program repair tools: A large-scale experiment on 2,141 bugs and 23,551 repair attempts, pp. 302-313, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Deakin University; Monash University; NASA Ames Research Centre","35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2020","","Virtual, Melbourne; VIC; Melbourne Arts Centre","166082","","9781450367684","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090838760"

As an alternative to relying on de-identification systems, we propose the following solutions: (1) Mapping the corpus of documents to standardized medical vocabulary (concept unique identifier [CUI] codes mapped from the Unified Medical Language System) thus eliminating PHI as inputs to a machine learning model; and (2) training character-based machine learning models that obviate the need for a dictionary containing input words/n-grams. We aim to test the performance of models with and without PHI in a use-case for an opioid misuse classifier. Methods: An observational cohort sampled from adult hospital inpatient encounters at a health system between 2007 and 2017. A case-control stratified sampling (n = 1000) was performed to build an annotated dataset for a reference standard of cases and non-cases of opioid misuse. Models for training and testing included CUI codes, character-based, and n-gram features. Models applied were machine learning with neural network and logistic regression as well as expert consensus with a rule-based model for opioid misuse. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) were compared between models for discrimination. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and visual plots measured model fit and calibration. Results: Machine learning models with CUI codes performed similarly to n-gram models with PHI. The top performing models with AUROCs > 0.90 included CUI codes as inputs to a convolutional neural network, max pooling network, and logistic regression model. The top calibrated models with the best model fit were the CUI-based convolutional neural network and max pooling network. The top weighted CUI codes in logistic regression has the related terms 'Heroin' and 'Victim of abuse'. Conclusions: We demonstrate good test characteristics for an opioid misuse computable phenotype that is void of any PHI and performs similarly to models that use PHI. Herein we share a PHI-free, trained opioid misuse classifier for other researchers and health systems to use and benchmark to overcome privacy and security concerns. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computable Phenotype; Heroin; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Opioid Misuse; Opioid Use Disorder; Adult; Electronic Health Record; Hospital Patient; Human; Machine Learning; Medical Record; Natural Language Processing; Opiate Addiction; Unified Medical Language System; Adult; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Inpatients; Machine Learning; Medical Records; Natural Language Processing; Opioid-related Disorders","adult; electronic health record; hospital patient; human; machine learning; medical record; natural language processing; opiate addiction; Unified Medical Language System; Adult; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Inpatients; Machine Learning; Medical Records; Natural Language Processing; Opioid-Related Disorders","","","Demner-Fushman, Dina, What can natural language processing do for clinical decision support?, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 42, 5, pp. 760-772, (2009); Jones, Barbara E., Development and Validation of a Natural Language Processing Tool to Identify Patients Treated for Pneumonia across VA Emergency Departments, Applied Clinical Informatics, 9, 1, pp. 122-128, (2018); Castro, Victor M., Large-scale identification of patients with cerebral aneurysms using natural language processing, Neurology, 88, 2, pp. 164-168, (2017); Carrell, David S., Using natural language processing to identify problem usage of prescription opioids, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 84, 12, pp. 1057-1064, (2015); Friedlin, F.

Identifying LVO in the pre-hospital setting or early stage of hospitalization would increase the patients’ chance of receiving appropriate reperfusion therapy and thereby improve neurological recovery. Methods: To enable rapid identification of LVO, we established an automated evaluation system based on all recorded AIS patients in Hong Kong Hospital Authority’s hospitals in 2016. The 300 study samples were randomly selected based on a disproportionate sampling plan within the integrated electronic health record system, and then separated into a group of 200 patients for model training, and another group of 100 patients for model performance evaluation. The evaluation system contained three hierarchical models based on patients’ demographic data, clinical data and non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. The first two levels of modeling utilized structured demographic and clinical data, while the third level involved additional NCCT imaging features obtained from deep learning model. All three levels’ modeling adopted multiple machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost). The optimal cut-off for the likelihood of LVO was determined by the maximal Youden index based on 10-fold cross-validation. Comparisons of performance on the testing group were made between these techniques. Results: Among the 300 patients, there were 160 women and 140 men aged from 27 to 104 years (mean 76.0 with standard deviation 13.4). LVO was present in 130 (43.3%) patients. Together with clinical and imaging features, the XGBoost model at the third level of evaluation achieved the best model performance on testing group. The Youden index, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.638, 0.800, 0.953, 0.684, 0.804, and 0.847, respectively. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study combining both structured clinical data with non-structured NCCT imaging data for the diagnosis of LVO in the acute setting, with superior performance compared to previously reported approaches. Our system is capable of automatically providing preliminary evaluations at different pre-hospital stages for potential AIS patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acute Ischemic Stroke; Deep Learning; Large Vessel Occlusion; Machine Learning; Prognosis; Adult; Aged; Area Under The Curve; Article; Artificial Neural Network; Brain Ischemia; Computer Assisted Tomography; Evaluation Study; Female; Human; Information Processing; Learning Algorithm; Machine Learning; Major Clinical Study; Male; National Institutes Of Health Stroke Scale; Prediction; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Retrospective Study; Sensitivity And Specificity; Social Hierarchy; Support Vector Machine; Training; Very Elderly; Youden Index","adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; brain ischemia; computer assisted tomography; evaluation study; female; human; information processing; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; social hierarchy; support vector machine; training; very elderly; Youden index","","","Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Chen, Zhicai, Novel Prehospital Prediction Model of Large Vessel Occlusion Using Artificial Neural Network, Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, 10, (2018); Cireşan, Dan Claudiu, Mitosis detection in breast cancer histology images with deep neural networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8150 LNCS, PART 2, pp. 411-418, (2013); Crookston, Nicholas L., yaImpute: An R package for κNN imputation, Journal of Statistical Software, 23, 10, pp. 1-16, (2008); Demeestere, Jelle, Validation of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-8 to Detect Large Vessel Occlusion in Ischemic Stroke, Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, 26, 7, pp. 1419-1426, (2017); Esteva, Andre, Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks, Nature, 542, 7639, pp. 115-118, (2017); Friedman, Jerome H., Stochastic gradient boosting, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 38, 4, pp. 367-378, (2002); Gasparian, Gregory G., Imaging of occlusive thrombi in acute ischemic stroke, International Journal of Stroke, 10, 3, pp. 298-305, (2015); Harbison, Joseph A., Diagnostic accuracy of stroke referrals from primary care, emergency room physicians, and ambulance staff using the face arm speech test, Stroke, 34, 1, pp. 71-76, (2003); Hastrup, Sidsel Gaarn, Prehospital acute stroke severity scale to predict large artery occlusion: Design and comparison with other scales, Stroke, 47, 7, pp. 1772-1776, (2016)","","Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org","","","","","","16625196","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083114202"

A novelty of our approach is the use of a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), which quantifies uncertainty of the estimated GA. Knowledge of estimated uncertainty is useful in clinical decision-making, and is especially important in ultrasound image analysis where image appearance and quality can naturally vary a lot. A further novelty of our approach is that the neural network is not provided with images pixel size, thus making it rely on anatomical appearance characteristics and not size. We train the network using 9,299 scans from the INTERGROWTH-21st[22] dataset ranging from weeks to weeks GA. We achieve average RMSE and MAE of 9.6 and 12.5 days respectively over the GA range. We explore the robustness of the BNN architecture to invalid input images by testing with (i) a different dataset derived from routine anomaly scanning and (ii) scans of a different fetal anatomy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Neural Networks; Fetal Ultrasound; Gestational Age Estimation; Uncertainty In Regression; Bayesian Networks; Computer Aided Analysis; Decision Making; Image Analysis; Medical Imaging; Pediatrics; Quality Control; Statistical Tests; Ultrasonics; Uncertainty Analysis; Bayesian Neural Networks; Clinical Decision Making; Fetal Ultrasound; Gestational Age; Image Appearance; Intergrowth; Ultrasound Image Analysis; Ultrasound Images; Neural Networks","Bayesian networks; Computer aided analysis; Decision making; Image analysis; Medical imaging; Pediatrics; Quality control; Statistical tests; Ultrasonics; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian neural networks; Clinical decision making; Fetal ultrasound; Gestational age; Image appearance; Intergrowth; Ultrasound image analysis; Ultrasound images; Neural networks","","","Generating Sentences from A Continuous Space, (2015); Cai, Yifan, Multi-task SonoEyeNet: Detection of fetal standardized planes assisted by generated sonographer attention maps, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11070 LNCS, pp. 871-879, (2018); Ciurte, Anca, Semi-supervised segmentation of ultrasound images based on patch representation and continuous min cut, PLOS ONE, 9, 7, (2014); undefined, (2017); Fu, Hao, Cyclical annealing schedule: A simple approach to mitigating KL vanishing, 1, pp. 240-250, (2019); Gill, Ravnoor Singh, Uncertainty-informed detection of epileptogenic brain malformations using bayesian neural networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11767 LNCS, pp. 225-233, (2019); Graves, Alex, Practical variational inference for neural networks, (2011); Guo, Chuan, On calibration of modern neural networks, 3, pp. 2130-2143, (2017); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); van den Heuvel, Thomas L.A., Automated Fetal Head Detection and Circumference Estimation from Free-Hand Ultrasound Sweeps Using Deep Learning in Resource-Limited Countries, Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology, 45, 3, pp. 773-785, (2019)","Hu, Y.; Licandro, R.; Noble, J.A.; Hutter, J.; Melbourne, A.; Aylward, S.; Abaci Turk, E.; Torrents Barrena, J.; Torrents Barrena, J.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH info@springer-sbm.com","","1st International Workshop on Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound, ASMUS 2020, and the 5th International Workshop on Perinatal, Preterm and Paediatric Image Analysis, PIPPI 2020, held in conjunction with the 23rd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2020","","Lima","249639","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092741338"

If the diagnosis and treatment are conducted too late, it may result in various degrees of vision loss, even blindness. Therefore, individuals with diabetes should have a regular annual eye exam. Studies showed that early detection can prevent vision loss in earlier stages. However, in places such as undeveloped or developing countries, and even sometimes rural areas in developed countries, may not have enough resources for DR screening. Furthermore, even though these places may have adequate equipment, the diagnosis may take a few days to obtain results for the analysis of the ophthalmologists. Developing an automated detection algorithm is an emerging research area to diagnose DR remotely using a retina image. Localizing the optic disc and fovea is an essential task in these DR detection algorithms. After locating the optic disc, finding other components of the retina is easier. Technological developments in recent years enable the acceleration of diagnosis of such diseases including DR. Deep learning techniques are becoming an essential part of the medical field. In the last years, there have been many attempts to automatize the analysis of medical disorders such as breast cancer, glaucoma, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy. In this paper, we presented the utilization of a pre-trained deep learning framework to localize the optic disc in the retina images. Using the transfer learning approach for AlexNet with a linear regression output, we localized the optic disc center. Retina images with labeled ground truth values of optic disc center were used to retrain the AlexNet. We tested our proposed deep learning-based optic disc localization approach with three different publicly available datasets including EyePACS, Messidor, and IDRID. Based on the results, the deep learning-based optic disc localization method shows high detection accuracy. The best results for optic disc detection were observed with cross dataset images as the accuracy of 88.35%, while a 97.66% testing accuracy was observed for the merged dataset using transfer learning approach for the pretrained AlexNet. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alexnet; Classification; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Diabetic Retinopathy; Eyepacs; Idrid; Localization; Messidor; Optic Disc; Regression; Retinal Imaging; Transfer Learning; Developing Countries; Diagnosis; Eye Protection; Learning Systems; Ophthalmology; Signal Detection; Statistical Tests; Transfer Learning; Vision; Automated Detection; Developed Countries; Diabetic Retinopathy; Learning Frameworks; Learning Techniques; Optic Disc Detections; Optic Disc Localization; Technological Development; Deep Learning","Developing countries; Diagnosis; Eye protection; Learning systems; Ophthalmology; Signal detection; Statistical tests; Transfer learning; Vision; Automated detection; Developed countries; Diabetic retinopathy; Learning frameworks; Learning techniques; Optic disc detections; Optic disc localization; Technological development; Deep learning","","","Bourne, Rupert R.A., Causes of vision loss worldwide, 1990-2010: A systematic analysis, The Lancet Global Health, 1, 6, pp. e339-e349, (2013); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report US Department of Health and Human Services; Kempen, John H., The Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy among Adults in the United States, Archives of Ophthalmology, 122, 4, pp. 552-563, (2004); Hacisoftaoglu, Recep Emre, Field of view of portable ophthalmoscopes for smartphones, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 11020, (2019); Johnson, Renoh C., Comparative analysis of university of auckland diabetic retinopathy database, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 235-239, (2017); Johnson, Renoh C., Automatic segmentation of retinal vasculature, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 886-890, (2017); Philip, Sam, The efficacy of automated ""disease/no disease"" grading for diabetic retinopathy in a systematic screening programme, British Journal of Ophthalmology, 91, 11, pp. 1512-1517, (2007); Karnowski, Thomas P., Retina image analysis and ocular telehealth: The oak ridge national laboratory-hamilton eye institute case study, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 7140-7143, (2013); Garg, Seema, Telemedicine and retinal imaging for improving diabetic retinopathy evaluation, Archives of Internal Medicine, 172, 21, pp. 1677-1678, (2012); Idx Dr, (2020)","Blowers, M.; Hall, R.D.; Dasari, V.R.","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Disruptive Technologies in Information Sciences IV 2020","","None","160362","0277786X; 1996756X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510688728; 9781510688629; 9781510692671; 9781510693326","PSISD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086140709"

The framework, named as Seg4Reg, contains two deep neural networks focusing on segmentation and regression, respectively. Based on the results generated by the segmentation model, the regression network directly predicts the cobb angles from segmentation masks. To alleviate the domain shift problem appeared between training and testing sets, we also conduct a domain adaptation module into network structures. Finally, by ensembling the predictions of different models, our method achieves 21.71 SMAPE in the testing set. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cobb Angle; Deep Learning; Spinal Curvature Estimation; Computational Methods; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks; Medical Imaging; Cobb Angles; Domain Adaptation; Network Structures; Segmentation Masks; Segmentation Models; Spinal Curvature; Training And Testing; Radiology","Computational methods; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Medical imaging; Cobb angles; Domain adaptation; Network structures; Segmentation masks; Segmentation models; Spinal curvature; Training and testing; Radiology","","","Chen, Bo, An automated and accurate spine curve analysis system, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 124596-124605, (2019); Encoder Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation, (2018); Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation, (2014); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Wu, Hongbo, Automatic landmark estimation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis assessment using BoostNet, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10433 LNCS, pp. 127-135, (2017); Wu, Hongbo, Automated comprehensive Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis assessment using MVC-Net, Medical Image Analysis, 48, pp. 1-11, (2018); Zhao, Hengshuang, Pyramid scene parsing network, 2017-January, pp. 6230-6239, (2017)","Cai, Y.; Wang, L.; Audette, M.; Zheng, G.; Li, S.","Springer","","6th International Workshop and Challenge on Computational Methods and Clinical Applications for Spine Imaging, CSI 2019, held in conjunction with the 22nd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2019","","Shenzhen","237239","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080919518"
